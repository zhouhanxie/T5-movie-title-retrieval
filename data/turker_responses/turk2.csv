There's something infinitely enjoyable about horror that's goo fun without trying to be anything more than it is.  Growing up watching 80's an 90's vieo store horror, these films just fill me with nostalgia... thinking more 'the tone' of these types of movies rather than the era.  They're often not brainless - the cleverness comes from being self aware an leaning into what it oes best.

Examples of movies I have watche over an over again - The Faculty, Return of the Living Dea 2, Species, House on Haunte Hill, Resient Evil (the first one particularly), 28 Days Later, Feast.

We have a preference for inie movies but it oesn't have to be an inie prouction.

Previous movies in these genres we've both enjoye:

Things to be avoie:   
gore (one or two scenes where it's clearly avertise before so you can close your eyes is fine), too much alternative worlbuiling (like sci fi set in a mae up society), lots of animals being harme, scenes of sexual assault or similar sexualise violence  


Things that we both appreciate in these genres:   
slowburn storytelling, likeable main characters, some sort of munane setting, ghosts, ambiguous or hopeful enings (where at least one person survives), interesting ""what if?"" concepts being explore, weir time/space phenomena, people trying to make contact with ghosts or aliens through technology, when whatever is the focus of the film isn't fully explaine but remains mysterious","Looking for horror, sci fi or horror/sci-fi to watch with my mum","The Innocents (1961), The Changeling, Host (2020), Under the Shadow, The Vigil, The Djinn, Pulse (2001), The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, The Woman in Black, The Tenant, Rosemary's Baby, The Endless, Resolution, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, Coherence, Annihilation, Sputnik, Sunshine, Alien, Black Box."

I like action movies where the villain spens the whole film talking trash an acting tough an being a ick, only to en with his emise within secons of facing the protagonist, revealing he was just a piece of shit.
Maybe the hero is overpowere,  or he actually traine har or is just better at what he oes than the villain, oesn’t matter, usually the fun part is just getting to the main villain.

I get a sense of satisfaction with these type of films. I’ve seen so many long boring fights where hope seems lost just for the hero to come through at the en, that it just oesn’t o it for me anymore, since it is kin of obvious the hero will win.

Films that explore mysteries an become mysteries themselves.   
Films that are ripe with atmosphere, symbolism, an an overall enigmatic aura.   
Films that prefer ream logic over realism an conventional narratives.  
Films that plunge into the surreal an the subconcious.  
Films that are unpreictable, where anything is possible.  
Films that are not afrai to confuse or leave questions unanswere.  
Films that are artistic, immersive, thought-provoking experiences.  
Films like the works of Davi Lynch or Alejanro Joorowosky, whom I'm both fairly familiar with.  


Other examples in this category which I truly enjoye woul be: Last Year at Marienba, Valerie an her Week of Woners, Hausu, Lips of Bloo, Inferno, Uner The Silver Lake, The Strange Colour of Your Boy's Tears, The Wil Boys. Thus sai, I' prefer nothing too abstract or isturbing like Begotten, but Horror is basically fine. Thanks to everyboy in avance, I'm really excite for your suggestions.","Mysterious, enigmatic, surreal films that raise more questions than answers","Begotten, Last Year at Marienba, Valerie an her Week of Woners, Hausu, Lips of Bloo, Inferno, Uner The Silver Lake, The Strange Colour of Your Boy's Tears, The Wil Boys,"

This year, I want to make some funny eits where I cleverly cut scenes together that will make up the journey of one of our team members who is late catching the bus to the event.   


So I am looking for scenes where the actors are having a conversation, where i can cut out one of the camera angles so that it looks as if my colleague is having a conversation with the actual actor in the film. So I nee scenes where only one person is in the angle at any given time. So far I have scenes from Fast &amp; Furious, Limitless an The Gofather.  


Any ieas from you movie buffs woul help me a LOT.  


Thank you","Looking for Movie Scenes I can cut into a funny personal video","Fast & Furious, Limitless, The Gofather"

The responses I receive inclue Closer, Chloe, an Little Chilren, none of which remotely fit the bill (ue to their lack of orchestral sountrack especially).

I can’t seem to believe that there are no other movies out like Unfaithful which have a eep/ramatic orchestra sountrack an a serious meloramatic tone throughout the movie. Essentially, I’m asking if there are any more just like it?

(Only one other movie is similar an that is Presume Innocent which also maintains a very meloramatic tone with John William’s monothematic ramatic score playing throughout.)","I’m shocked to hear that there are no melodramas like Unfaithful that exist.

He was in there in a wheelchair but worke with the nurses to get walking an his strength. An he ha a terrible attitue until he met her.  They woul sneak out at night passe the guars to go to the roof top. They woul sneak into eachothers rooms. The nurses trie to keep them apart because they weren't suppose to be aroun eachother. I remember them both shaving their heas at one point.

I remember a scene where he was watching her through her winow while she was having a seizure (I think).  She ene up ying in his arms in her room one night an he ie either later that night or a few ays later.

I coul be getting some of these scenes wrong but I remember watching it on TV with my mom when I was like 14ish. An it's stuck with me an I want to rewatch it with her since she remembers it too. But we can't remember what it's calle an it's riving me nuts

I'm looking for movies that have killer scenes using music, choreography, outstaning sountracks, etc.  Something that will stop a movie ea in it's tracks in the best way possible.  I'll try an escribe what I'm looking for.

Killer uses of music in the movie - Sometimes the song is in the movie, an it just makes everything better.  The missing reel in Death Proof with the lap ance to Down In Mexico.  The auition scene in Mulhollan Drive to 16 Reasons where it starts with the singers, an keeps revealing more an more.  The outstaning opening ance to Climax.

Absur scenes that are so far away from the rest of the movie that you spen the first 30 secons going ""what on earth is going on?"" - The inner scene in Beetlejuice, The rugge out ream scene in The Big Lebowski, that scene in the mile of Southlan Tales where Justin Timberlake is singing along to The Killers in an arcae with a bunch of pinup girls.

Scenes where the music is part of the sountrack but it is just so amn goo - The opening alternate history of Watchmen, the Ma Worl ening to Richar Kelly's first movie that I on't know if I'm allowe to mention.

Scenes where the choreography or camera work or practical effects are outstaning - like the flipping-between-two-girls ance scene in Last Night In Soho.

Some combination of all of these - The ance scene in Clerks 2 that's kin of a joke, an then is kina sweet, an then all of a suen there's like 50 choreographe ancers in a Clerks movie, the ream-like birthay party ance from Girl Asleep an then everyone is ancing an finally the main character lets loose a bit.

Here's a few scenes that have been on my min:

Beetlejuice, The inner (Banana Boat Song - Harry Belafonte)  
The Big Lebowski, Drugge Due (Just Droppe In - Kenny Rogers)  
Clerks 2, Learning to ance (ABC - Jackson 5) (Also, can we all just appreciate that Kevin Smith put a freaking ance number in a Clerks movie an it was awesome?)  
Climax, A very goo time before a very ba time (Supernature - Cerrone)  
Dark City, The throwback nightclub (Sway / The Night Has A Thousan Eyes - Anita Kesley / Jennifer Connelly)  
Death Proof, The missing reel (Down In Mexico - The Coasters)  
Girl Asleep, Happy Birthay party (You Make Me Feel - Sylvester)  
Last Night In Soho, It blows my min they i this in-camera (Wae In The Water - Graham Bon Organization)  
The Lure, Welcome to the club (I Feel Love - Kinga Preis)  
The Lure, Let's go shopping (I Came To The City - Kinga Preis)  
Mulhollan Drive, The Auition (16 Reasons - Connie Stevens) (Yes I actually like that over the Silencio scene.)  
Southlan Tales, Dream a little ream with Justin Timberlake (All These Things I've Done - The Killers)  
Southlan Tales, A very unexpecte Star Spangle Banner (The US National Anthem - Rebekah Del Rio)  
Southlan Tales, Zeppelin ance off/Floating ice-cream truck of impening apocalypse (Memory Gospel - Moby)  
Watchmen, Alternate history intro (The Times They Are A-Changing - Bob Dylan)  


I think I remember Oceans 11 having an outstaning ening where they all walk away from the Bellagio Fountains set to Claire De Lune, but it has been a long time since I've seen it.  I think I remember Gamer having a really unexpecte ance scene in it too, but haven't seen that for a long time either.

An bonus points for episoe 3 of Ms. Marvel with the weing ance.  They all looke like they were having such a goo time.
