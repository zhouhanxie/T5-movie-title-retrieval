There's something infinitely enjoyable about horror that's goo fun without trying to be anything more than it is.  Growing up watching 80's an 90's vieo store horror, these films just fill me with nostalgia... thinking more 'the tone' of these types of movies rather than the era.  They're often not brainless - the cleverness comes from being self aware an leaning into what it oes best.

I like action movies where the villain spens the whole film talking trash an acting tough an being a ick, only to en with his emise within secons of facing the protagonist, revealing he was just a piece of shit.
Maybe the hero is overpowere,  or he actually traine har or is just better at what he oes than the villain, oesn’t matter, usually the fun part is just getting to the main villain.

I get a sense of satisfaction with these type of films. I’ve seen so many long boring fights where hope seems lost just for the hero to come through at the en, that it just oesn’t o it for me anymore, since it is kin of obvious the hero will win.

Examples woul be Robocop (original), Dre, The Witch: Subversion, John Wick, an  series like One Punch Man.
I’m sure I’ve seen other but can’t remember, so, if you can recommen movies (or series) like this, please o., an thanks.","Action movies where the protagonist disposed of the main villain with ease instead of a 15 minute fight?","Robocop (original),The Witch: Subversion,John Wick,an series like One Punch Man"

We have a preference for inie movies but it oesn't have to be an inie prouction.

Previous movies in these genres we've both enjoye:

Things to be avoie:   
gore (one or two scenes where it's clearly avertise before so you can close your eyes is fine), too much alternative worlbuiling (like sci fi set in a mae up society), lots of animals being harme, scenes of sexual assault or similar sexualise violence  


Things that we both appreciate in these genres:   
slowburn storytelling, likeable main characters, some sort of munane setting, ghosts, ambiguous or hopeful enings (where at least one person survives), interesting ""what if?"" concepts being explore, weir time/space phenomena, people trying to make contact with ghosts or aliens through technology, when whatever is the focus of the film isn't fully explaine but remains mysterious","Looking for horror, sci fi or horror/sci-fi to watch with my mum","he Innocents (1961) The Changeling Host (2020) Uner the Shaow The Vigil The Djinn Pulse (2001) The Blair Witch Project Paranormal Activity The Woman in Black The Tenant Rosemary's Baby The Enless Resolution Invasion of the Boysnatchers 2001 Moon Coherence Annihilation Sputnik Sunshine Alien Black Box"

The early parts of the game have you in a [European town with fog](https://uploa.wikimeia.org/wikipeia/commons//e/Syberia_04_-_Valail%C3%A8ne.jpg) (an occasionally rain), an it really gives you a vibe of loneliness an isolation.  Settings like the [town's cemetery](https://i0.wp.com/waytoomany.games/wp-content/uploas/2018/08/DM16ri4VQAAOzmX.jpg), the [surrouning woos](http://gamerwalkthroughs.com/wp-content/uploas/2015/08/Syberia-Walkthrough-Valailene-Forest.jpg), an the [factory](http://gamerwalkthroughs.com/wp-content/uploas/2015/08/Syberia-Walkthrough-Factory-Courtyar.jpg) were lovely to me.  


Similarly, [*Silent Hill*](https://www.themovieb.org/movie/588-silent-hill) ha a lovely aesthetic with those [gray, ashy skies an bleary lighting](https://www.pluggein.com/wp-content/uploas/2019/12/silent-hill.png).  (Not particularly looking for a vieo game aaptation, min you, but those two really games are great examples.)  The mooiness is the seller for me here, an it's probably only going to be foun in rama films.  (Or possibly among more serious horror—[*The Witch*](https://www.themovieb.org/movie/310131-the-witch) is another one which really gave me the tone I'm seeking here, an [*The Others*](https://www.themovieb.org/movie/1933-the-others) an the first half of [*Gretel &amp; Hansel*](https://www.themovieb.org/movie/542224-gretel-an-hansel) hit pretty close, too.)  


The mere presence of rain/fog/arkness oesn't o it, so films like *Dark City* an *Blae Runner* aren't what I'm looking for.  Got any great suggestions for me?  ","Rainy, foggy, moody, atmospheric!","Syberia, Dark City, Blade Runner"

Films that explore mysteries an become mysteries themselves.

It was on TV in the early 2000's. So I'm assuming it was filme in the 90's. 

What I can remember :  It was about two teens who were in the hospital for some sort of iagnosis's. I remember him being kin of a ""ba boy"". He was in there in a wheelchair but worke with the nurses to get walking an his strength. An he ha a terrible attitue until he met her.  They woul sneak out at night passe the guars to go to the roof top. They woul sneak into eachothers rooms. The nurses trie to keep them apart because they weren't suppose to be aroun eachother. I remember them both shaving their heas at one point.

I remember a scene where he was watching her through her winow while she was having a seizure (I think).  She ene up ying in his arms in her room one night an he ie either later that night or a few ays later.

I coul be getting some of these scenes wrong but I remember watching it on TV with my mom when I was like 14ish. An it's stuck with me an I want to rewatch it with her since she remembers it too. But we can't remember what it's calle an it's riving me nuts 

So I've come to ask reit for help","Sad Romance between 2 teens in hospital. (90's to early 2000s)",","

I'm looking for movies that have killer scenes using music, choreography, outstaning sountracks, etc.  Something that will stop a movie ea in it's tracks in the best way possible.  I'll try an escribe what I'm looking for.

Killer uses of music in the movie - Sometimes the song is in the movie, an it just makes everything better.  The missing reel in Death Proof with the lap ance to Down In Mexico.  The auition scene in Mulhollan Drive to 16 Reasons where it starts with the singers, an keeps revealing more an more.  The outstaning opening ance to Climax.

Absur scenes that are so far away from the rest of the movie that you spen the first 30 secons going ""what on earth is going on?"" - The inner scene in Beetlejuice, The rugge out ream scene in The Big Lebowski, that scene in the mile of Southlan Tales where Justin Timberlake is singing along to The Killers in an arcae with a bunch of pinup girls.

Scenes where the music is part of the sountrack but it is just so amn goo - The opening alternate history of Watchmen, the Ma Worl ening to Richar Kelly's first movie that I on't know if I'm allowe to mention.

Scenes where the choreography or camera work or practical effects are outstaning - like the flipping-between-two-girls ance scene in Last Night In Soho.

Some combination of all of these - The ance scene in Clerks 2 that's kin of a joke, an then is kina sweet, an then all of a suen there's like 50 choreographe ancers in a Clerks movie, the ream-like birthay party ance from Girl Asleep an then everyone is ancing an finally the main character lets loose a bit.

Here's a few scenes that have been on my min:

Beetlejuice, The inner (Banana Boat Song - Harry Belafonte)  
The Big Lebowski, Drugge Due (Just Droppe In - Kenny Rogers)  
Clerks 2, Learning to ance (ABC - Jackson 5) (Also, can we all just appreciate that Kevin Smith put a freaking ance number in a Clerks movie an it was awesome?)  
Climax, A very goo time before a very ba time (Supernature - Cerrone)  
Dark City, The throwback nightclub (Sway / The Night Has A Thousan Eyes - Anita Kesley / Jennifer Connelly)  
Death Proof, The missing reel (Down In Mexico - The Coasters)  
Girl Asleep, Happy Birthay party (You Make Me Feel - Sylvester)  
Last Night In Soho, It blows my min they i this in-camera (Wae In The Water - Graham Bon Organization)  
The Lure, Welcome to the club (I Feel Love - Kinga Preis)  
The Lure, Let's go shopping (I Came To The City - Kinga Preis)  
Mulhollan Drive, The Auition (16 Reasons - Connie Stevens) (Yes I actually like that over the Silencio scene.)  
Southlan Tales, Dream a little ream with Justin Timberlake (All These Things I've Done - The Killers)  
Southlan Tales, A very unexpecte Star Spangle Banner (The US National Anthem - Rebekah Del Rio)  
Southlan Tales, Zeppelin ance off/Floating ice-cream truck of impening apocalypse (Memory Gospel - Moby)  
Watchmen, Alternate history intro (The Times They Are A-Changing - Bob Dylan)  


I think I remember Oceans 11 having an outstaning ening where they all walk away from the Bellagio Fountains set to Claire De Lune, but it has been a long time since I've seen it.  I think I remember Gamer having a really unexpecte ance scene in it too, but haven't seen that for a long time either.

An bonus points for episoe 3 of Ms. Marvel with the weing ance.  They all looke like they were having such a goo time.

(An lastly, I have La La Lan on 4K, but haven't watche it yet.)","Looking for movies with unexpected dance scenes, sweet choreography, outstanding diegetic music sequences.","Beetlejuice, The Big Lebowski, Clerks 2, Climax, Dark City, Death Proof, Girl Asleep, Last Night In Soho, The Lure, Mulholland Drive, Southland Tales, Watchmen, Oceans 11, Gamer, Ms. Marvel (episode 3), La La Land."
