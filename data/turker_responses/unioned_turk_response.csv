I like action movies where the villain spens the whole film talking trash an acting tough an being a ick, only to en with his emise within secons of facing the protagonist, revealing he was just a piece of shit.
Maybe the hero is overpowere,  or he actually traine har or is just better at what he oes than the villain, oesn’t matter, usually the fun part is just getting to the main villain.

I get a sense of satisfaction with these type of films. I’ve seen so many long boring fights where hope seems lost just for the hero to come through at the en, that it just oesn’t o it for me anymore, since it is kin of obvious the hero will win.

Examples woul be Robocop (original), Dre, The Witch: Subversion, John Wick, an  series like One Punch Man.

The early parts of the game have you in a [European town with fog](https://uploa.wikimeia.org/wikipeia/commons//e/Syberia_04_-_Valail%C3%A8ne.jpg) (an occasionally rain), an it really gives you a vibe of loneliness an isolation.

Films that explore mysteries an become mysteries themselves.   
Films that are ripe with atmosphere, symbolism, an an overall enigmatic aura.   
Films that prefer ream logic over realism an conventional narratives.  
Films that plunge into the surreal an the subconcious.  
Films that are unpreictable, where anything is possible.  
Films that are not afrai to confuse or leave questions unanswere.  
Films that are artistic, immersive, thought-provoking experiences.  
Films like the works of Davi Lynch or Alejanro Joorowosky, whom I'm both fairly familiar with.  


Other examples in this category which I truly enjoye woul be: Last Year at Marienba, Valerie an her Week of Woners, Hausu, Lips of Bloo, Inferno, Uner The Silver Lake, The Strange Colour of Your Boy's Tears, The Wil Boys.

I'm looking for movies that have killer scenes using music, choreography, outstaning sountracks, etc.  Something that will stop a movie ea in it's tracks in the best way possible.  I'll try an escribe what I'm looking for.

Killer uses of music in the movie - Sometimes the song is in the movie, an it just makes everything better.  The missing reel in Death Proof with the lap ance to Down In Mexico.  The auition scene in Mulhollan Drive to 16 Reasons where it starts with the singers, an keeps revealing more an more.  The outstaning opening ance to Climax.

Absur scenes that are so far away from the rest of the movie that you spen the first 30 secons going ""what on earth is going on?"" - The inner scene in Beetlejuice, The rugge out ream scene in The Big Lebowski, that scene in the mile of Southlan Tales where Justin Timberlake is singing along to The Killers in an arcae with a bunch of pinup girls.

Scenes where the music is part of the sountrack but it is just so amn goo - The opening alternate history of Watchmen, the Ma Worl ening to Richar Kelly's first movie that I on't know if I'm allowe to mention.

Scenes where the choreography or camera work or practical effects are outstaning - like the flipping-between-two-girls ance scene in Last Night In Soho.

Some combination of all of these - The ance scene in Clerks 2 that's kin of a joke, an then is kina sweet, an then all of a suen there's like 50 choreographe ancers in a Clerks movie, the ream-like birthay party ance from Girl Asleep an then everyone is ancing an finally the main character lets loose a bit.

Here's a few scenes that have been on my min:

Beetlejuice, The inner (Banana Boat Song - Harry Belafonte)  
The Big Lebowski, Drugge Due (Just Droppe In - Kenny Rogers)  
Clerks 2, Learning to ance (ABC - Jackson 5) (Also, can we all just appreciate that Kevin Smith put a freaking ance number in a Clerks movie an it was awesome?)  
Climax, A very goo time before a very ba time (Supernature - Cerrone)  
Dark City, The throwback nightclub (Sway / The Night Has A Thousan Eyes - Anita Kesley / Jennifer Connelly)  
Death Proof, The missing reel (Down In Mexico - The Coasters)  
Girl Asleep, Happy Birthay party (You Make Me Feel - Sylvester)  
Last Night In Soho, It blows my min they i this in-camera (Wae In The Water - Graham Bon Organization)  
The Lure, Welcome to the club (I Feel Love - Kinga Preis)  
The Lure, Let's go shopping (I Came To The City - Kinga Preis)  
Mulhollan Drive, The Auition (16 Reasons - Connie Stevens) (Yes I actually like that over the Silencio scene.)  
Southlan Tales, Dream a little ream with Justin Timberlake (All These Things I've Done - The Killers)  
Southlan Tales, A very unexpecte Star Spangle Banner (The US National Anthem - Rebekah Del Rio)  
Southlan Tales, Zeppelin ance off/Floating ice-cream truck of impening apocalypse (Memory Gospel - Moby)  
Watchmen, Alternate history intro (The Times They Are A-Changing - Bob Dylan)
