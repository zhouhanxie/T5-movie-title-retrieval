To be fair, your post title and description didn't (for me, anyway-I could be alone in this) make this really clear. You only mentioned unnamed in your description 

&gt;Something like Taken, where Liam Neesan kills a bunch of sex traffickers. They have no name and are killed without much fanfare.

and I initially understood it as referencing the unnamed sex traffickers in Taken, not as an actual requirement for your request. Like I said though, maybe it's just me.

I read the novel before watching Manhunter, which was a serious treat because it really is the type of story which Michael Mann (director) can do wonders with. He's all about the crime genre typically with a chase/hunt between police and criminal, which is exactly what Red Dragon was, so imo he was the perfect match to bring the story to screen. Manhunter is extremely stylish and moody, it really captures the tone of the novel, and also has Hannibal Lecter feature just about the right amount. 

Red Dragon is flawed because it tried to do everything possible to milk the presence of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter following the huge wave he caused with Silence of the Lambs. A lot of movie goers, based on the marketing, thought Anthony Hopkins was going to be the main villain. (Particularly because they released Red Dragon after Silence of the Lambs, even if the book comes before it.) In the first novel he barely features, having only one really concrete scene, whereas in this film he has several to ensure they could market Anthony Hopkins. However, this film is not totally poor, it actually captures some aspects of the novel surrounding Dolarhyde (main villain) that Manhunter didn't touch on.

I must conclude that neither Manhunter or Red Dragon successfully captured the novel overall, both films did not include sufficient screentime to build the main villain up for the audience to get invested in his character. In the novel, he is built up from being a child, the reader experiences flashbacks where his childhood includes serious neglect and abuse, the films do not explore his childhood so Dolarhyde is portrayed as being far more cartoonish and evil without strong underlying motivations.

That being said, I think Manhunter is overall the better film, particularly how it captures the tone/mood of the novel. I really enjoyed Manhunter a lot, I did not enjoy Red Dragon one bit, and thought Ed Norton was completely flat as the main character, Will Graham.

Hope that helps if you are considering watching Manhunter.

Quick story about that movie. When I was a projectionist we had the first show of that and a quite packed house. One of the belts on the tower (running big 35mm reels) slipped at the start and produced this rhythmic low groan,  every couple of seconds, and as the reel got more empty, the timing became less, and sounded more frantic. Went on for the whole show. I was crapping myself, waiting for the complaints, as it was definitely audible in the screen. 4 groups of people asked about it and complemented us for the horrible ambience that added an extra note of dread to the film! They only worked out it wasn't the film sound when it was still groaning during the credits. Definitely my favourite fault ever.

I honestly think that the Dawn of the Dead remake was the spark that revitalized the zombie genre for our (I say âourâ assuming weâre around the same age if you also were introduced via DotD) generation. Itâs been beaten to death and more by now, but in the early 00s it wasnât a popping genre. Me and my friends would mall wander in our teens and talk about what weâd do in the event of a zombie outbreak (of course it would be at the mall because we were so original). That movie really sparked my love for the genre though and it was definitely a fantastic remake that didnât shit on the original.

The 1954 version of Sabrina 

I love the idea of an old black and white movie!  However, if you donât go newer, When Harry Met Sally is a great one because of all of the documentary style interviews of married couples and how they met that are sprinkled throughout the movie.  

With both of these movies, I would wait until the end to propose.

Roman Holiday is going to be the most popular choice for sure.

Other options, An Affair to Remember, Singin' In the Rain, An American in Paris?

The Princess Bride would be great although it just post 1980, but possibly waiting until after the shot at the end that when the narrator says, ""Since the invention of the kiss, there have only been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind."" and then kissing her and getting down on one knee could be so gorgeous!

Regardless I'd recommend at least skipping through the movie before watching it together to ensure it matches your guys' vibe and so you can plan your timing.

Extracted Movie Titles:","Roman Holiday is going to be the most popular choice for sure.

Other options, An Affair to Remember, Singin' In the Rain, An American in Paris?

The Princess Bride would be great although it just post 1980, but possibly waiting until after the shot at the end that when the narrator says, ""Since the invention of the kiss, there have only been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind."" and then kissing her and getting down on one knee could be so gorgeous!

Regardless I'd recommend at least skipping through the movie before watching it together to ensure it matches your guys' vibe and so you can plan your timing.

- RUNNING SCARED

A man is told by his mob boss to dispose of a gun that is linked with a murder. Seems simple enough, but it seems the universe does not want this man to get rid of that gun. Everything that could go wrong does go wrong, and he spends all night putting out fires. There were parts of this film that actually made me sweat profusely.

ââââââ
- THE DEPARTED

Focuses on a young guy who became a cop in order to operate as a mole for the mob, and another cop working undercover in that same mob. Both the police and the mob are aware they have a mole but are unaware of his identity. The formerâs task is to figure out the identity of the latter without getting exposed himself, and vice versa. Exceptional acting from all is what really makes this one special.

ââââââ
- LE MANS â66 (OR âFORD VS FERRARIâ IF YOUâRE IN THE STATES)

Probably more the kind of tension you were referring to. Not so much of a suspense âthrillerâ as the others, but just as was the case in Whiplash, the tension comes from the fact the protagonist is a flawed but highly skilled person who has to constantly beat the tide, so to speak, in order to succeed. The intensity that comes with the fine margins and undertones of danger that formula one races entail really adds to the experience.

ââââââ
- NO ESCAPE (2015)

Man goes to Southeast Asia with his family on business, and the country goes into meltdown due to a civilian uprising. Seeing that Americans are being slaughtered in the streets, he has to find a way to keep his wife and two daughters safe. To say that this movie is intense would be one hell of an understatement.

ââââââ
- 1917

Two soldiers have to travel across an infinitely dangerous war zone in order to deliver a vital message that would save the lives of 1600 soldiers who, itâs discovered, are just hours away from walking straight into a fatal trap set by the enemy. In order to do so, they themselves have to travel through areas where nowhere is safe, under the constant and inescapable threat of death. Exceptional and relentless film.

ââââââ
- RUN (2020)

This is one of those films where you just have to watch it and take my word that itâs a hell of a ride. Any attempt to read about the plot or watch the trailer would only serve to spoil said ride. Nail biting as hell, but do not look it up first. Just watch. And enjoy.  

ââââââ

Also if youâre open to TV shows that have the same kind of intensity, Iâd suggestâ¦

ââââââ
- THE SPY (2019 NETFLIX MINISERIES)

True story about an Israeli spy who has to infiltrate the Syrian government. What makes this so tense is the fact that we know he will be executed if heâs caught, and yet he consistently has to take colossal risks in order to acquire the intelligence he needs. Sacha Baron Cohen plays the main character and he did a really good job here.

ââââââ
- THE HANDMAIDâS TALE

Dystopian thriller where a pandemic of infertility leads to the American Government being overthrown by an extremist totalitarian regime that enslaves fertile women as âHandmaidsâ, and forces them to effectively become sexual slaves. Seen through the eyes of June Osborn (expertly played by Elisabeth Moss) who, like others, was enslaved after being torn from her husband and child. Now in a militarised society under constant surveillance she has to find her way back to her family and out of the country. This show literally has everything, and my God itâs intense. Iâm trembling right now just thinking about certain scenes.

ââââââ
- OZARK

A man with no options left has to drag his family to the Ozarks in order to launder drug money for the Mexican Cartel. Knowing that one misstep would mean he and his family would be killed, he has to find a way to successfully launder millions of dollars on a regular basis under the constant threat of death. All whilst having the cartel, the local Ozark âkingpinsâ, and the FBI watching his every move. Anxiety inducing (but not in a bad way).

whiplash is in my top 10 of all time. off the top of my head, i canât think of any movies with the exact same flavor or lack of violence/horror, or a theme of someone being manipulated/trained/broken by authority. but i agree that you would probably like prisoners. also, one i havenât seen mentioned is ârawâ, if you donât mind watching a movie with subtitles. a vegetarian girl goes to vet school and has to eat raw meat during initiation. this seems to switch on some animalistic thing inside her. this one is a bit more weird and gory, but you do see a college-aged character slowly sinking into a dark place while trying to figure out whatâs really happening. 
lastly, a movie like truman show or fight club might be nice for you; questioning reality, start to lose it a bit. nocturnal animals is really good too.

Extracted Movie Titles:","whiplash is in my top 10 of all time. off the top of my head, i canât think of any movies with the exact same flavor or lack of violence/horror, or a theme of someone being manipulated/trained/broken by authority. but i agree that you would probably like prisoners. also, one i havenât seen mentioned is ârawâ, if you donât mind watching a movie with subtitles. a vegetarian girl goes to vet school and has to eat raw meat during initiation. this seems to switch on some animalistic thing inside her. this one is a bit more weird and gory, but you do see a college-aged character slowly sinking into a dark place while trying to figure out whatâs really happening. 
lastly, a movie like truman show or fight club might be nice for you; questioning reality, start to lose it a bit. nocturnal animals is really good too.","Whiplash, Prisoners, Raw, Truman Show, Fight Club, Nocturnal Animals"

I know that it's horror but it's not very actually scary. But, it truly felt like an intense fever dream. Such a good film.

Also, Good Time.

Punch Drunk Love is also pretty great but can be a little too intense for some.

I donât know if this is your vibe, but Whiplash and The Wall (1982) are the *only* movies Iâve ever had a panic attack during. Like, had to pause until I stopped hyperventilating and crying. I wasnât even a Pink Floyd fan when I watched The Wall. It just fucked with me so badly. Not a âhorrorâ movie but I couldnât stop thinking about it for days, similar to how I felt after Whiplash. 


I still donât know why.

Same. I have anxiety disorders and watching that movie really triggered them. Like the way they always talk over each other and everything is so cluttered and loud and always active is just so anxiety inducing. They really captured that feel of a busy shop with a bunch of high-strung people talking over each other. I couldnât handle being in that place IRL lol.

And thatâs not to mention what actually happens throughout the movie. Thatâs just the introduction lol.

Please post there or repost with a more descriptive explanation of what you are looking for :) (including a descriptive title)

The play is ""The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940."" My character is a rich lady inviting a musical theater production team and some actors to her house under the guise of producing a show, but hoping to solve a murder mystery. Her father was a German spy, and she claims espionage is in her blood. Sometimes she seems like an airhead, sometimes she's very with it. Probably lesbian or bi based on some of her lines. Very friendly. Sometimes seems like she's all over the place. I'm not looking for someone to copy specifically, so it doesn't have to be an exact match of her character. Friendly eccentric is probably the best description of what I'm aiming for in my own portrayal, but I'm interested in seeing other ranges.

well that helps a lot.

Sounds like you should check out Elsa Lanchester. She's famous for being the original Bride of Frankenstein, but her career is full of eccentric characters. *Witness for the Prosecution* and *Murder By Death* are both in the same vein as your play. Her character in ~~Odd Man Out~~  *The Big Clock* is a great eccentric artist. Most of her roles are smaller though and you can probably get what you need from just watching clips instead of whole movies (which this sub won't let me provide).

Since Fail Safe and Crimson Tide have both been suggested already, Iâll try a few off the beaten path ones: 

Shin Godzilla - plays like a Veep-esque satire of bureaucracyâs in ability to handle a Godzilla type threat

Unstoppable - doesnât make its way up to presidential levels but the runaway train does have disaster potential

Contact - how would the president handle a message sent from deep space instructing us to build some mysterious machine

The Black Mirror episode âHated in the Nationâ

And finally, in case you havenât seen them: a Michael Bay double feature Armageddon &amp; The Rock

Existenz (1999) and Thirteenth Floor (1999). They came out the same year as Matrix. They all have similar themes, and these two just kinda got buried in Matrix hype.

Existenz is decidedly Cronenberg. I thought it was his best movie at the time. Thirteenth Floor, I might be overating it, because I really disliked Matrix, but it's got Vincent D'Onofrio. It couldn't have been too bad. I enjoyed it any how.

If you liked The 5th Wave, then I'd recommend The Darkest Minds - as while it is based on a different book, it is still the same type of film - it's a YA sci-fi action/adventure film, it has an apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic setting, the type of story it tells is broadly the same, and overall, it's a movie to watch if you like The 5th Wave.

I know some of my recommendations will be repeats of other recommendations, but I'm still making them (mostly because the more mention these films get, the better).

Also, to avoid this post getting longer than it already is, I'll try to keep each entry brief (I know this is a long post, but I was trying to not go overboard in my descriptions of each film). If anyone wants more detail, tell me. Also, to avoid saying this every time, if the combination of genres seem interesting, then I'd recommend the film.

Sci-fi/young adult/action/adventure (with some elements of thriller and drama with an apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic setting - there are also a few elements of dystopia):

* **The Darkest Minds.** After a disease kills most of the children in the US, the few who remain develop supernatural abilities, and they are locked up by the US government. Ruby, the main character, is on the run after escaping one of the prison camps where the children are held, and is trying to survive and reach as safe-haven with a group of children she found while on the run.
* **The 5th Wave.** The alien invasion came in waves. The first took out the power. The second was a series of colossal floods, dealing devastation to coastal cities. The third was disease - killing billions. The fourth, you don't know if someone is human, or alien. The 5th wave... No-one knows what it is, but it is coming. The human race is facing extinction and Cassie, one of the few remaining survivors risks her life in order to rescue her younger brother.
* (These two films are similar, and if you like one, I'd recommend the other. (Edit). If you enjoy The Darkest minds, I'd recommend The Darkest Minds books - if you liked the film, you'll like the books, as they're good for the same reasons. While I can't speak personally as I have only read a small amount of The 5th Wave in the past, from what I can tell (my memory of it, and points raised by others, the books and movie are similar, so as far as I an tell, the books are something to try if you like the movie for The 5th Wave). (Edit end). 

Sci-fi/action/adventure/thriller:

* **Awake.** A mysterious event takes out electronics across the globe. But it also prevent people from being able to sleep, and everyone is on a ticking clock before they die from sleep deprivation. In this, a mother discovers her daughter is able to sleep - meaning she could be the key to humanity, and she is forced to decide whether to protect her child, or potentially have her be sacrificed to save humanity. A specific point about this movie is that it does not forget things about its characters, and it does a good job of having even minor points actually mean something instead of just being something thrown around and then forgotten.
* **Extinction.** A man living a seemingly normal life begins to experience a series of strange nightmares. Then as an alien invasion strikes Earth, he needs to escape with his family.

Sci-fi/action/thriller:

* **Spectral.** A DARPA research is flown in to Moldova during a conflict in the country to provide his knowledge on one of the pieces of equipment he created which was issued to some soldiers. In that equipment, there are sightings of these strange humanoid things and soon, the force of soldiers he is with now has to fight to save their lives against enemies which can't be stopped with conventional firepower.

Sci-fi/action/war (with some elements of drama):

* **Battle: Los Angeles.** This is primarily an action movie with a sci-fi setting, but it still is a sci-fi movie and it does a good job at being entertaining. After aliens launch a coordinated invasion of Earth, a Marine platoon is sent on a mission to rescue civilians trapped behind enemy lines.
* **The Tomorrow War (this has more of drama as a genre than Battle: Los Angeles).** Yes, I am aware that The Tomorrow has a number of flaws, and there are a number of areas that I'd change, but it's still entertaining. In the future, aliens have invaded Earth and humanity is pushed back to the brink, and some soldiers are sent back to gather support in what to us (at the time) was the present. Once the soldiers from Earth's militaries are not enough, a draft is issued to make up for the high number of casualties and the main character of the film is drafted.

Sci-fi/thriller/action/adventure/drama/disaster:

* **Greenland.** A comet is heading straight for Earth, and a structural engineer is in a race against time to reach his family, and for them to then get to safety.

Sci-fi/thriller/drama (with some action):

* **Prospect.** A father and daughter go on a mission to harvest precious stones on an alien world, however it soon turns into a fight for their survival. This film is also a good example of how a quality film can be produced with a budget of less than 4 million dollars, and I have seen sci-fi films with significantly higher budgets which are much worse than this film.

Sci-fi/action/adventure:

* **Rim of the World.** Four misfit teens who were at a summer camp are forced by circumstance to work together to transport the key to defeating the alien invasion. This is more of a 'kid' movie than the other films, but it's still what I'd say is a hidden gen sci-fi film.

Ruby, the main character, is on the run after escaping one of the prison camps where the children are held, and is trying to survive and reach as safe-haven with a group of children she found while on the run.
* **The 5th Wave.** The alien invasion came in waves. The first took out the power. The second was a series of colossal floods, dealing devastation to coastal cities. The third was disease - killing billions. The fourth, you don't know if someone is human, or alien. The 5th wave... No-one knows what it is, but it is coming. The human race is facing extinction and Cassie, one of the few remaining survivors risks her life in order to rescue her younger brother.
* (These two films are similar, and if you like one, I'd recommend the other. (Edit). If you enjoy The Darkest minds, I'd recommend The Darkest Minds books - if you liked the film, you'll like the books, as they're good for the same reasons. While I can't speak personally as I have only read a small amount of The 5th Wave in the past, from what I can tell (my memory of it, and points raised by others, the books and movie are similar, so as far as I an tell, the books are something to try if you like the movie for The 5th Wave). (Edit end). 

Sci-fi/action/adventure/thriller:

* **Awake.** A mysterious event takes out electronics across the globe. But it also prevent people from being able to sleep, and everyone is on a ticking clock before they die from sleep deprivation. In this, a mother discovers her daughter is able to sleep - meaning she could be the key to humanity, and she is forced to decide whether to protect her child, or potentially have her be sacrificed to save humanity. A specific point about this movie is that it does not forget things about its characters, and it does a good job of having even minor points actually mean something instead of just being something thrown around and then forgotten.
* **Extinction.** A man living a seemingly normal life begins to experience a series of strange nightmares. Then as an alien invasion strikes Earth, he needs to escape with his family.

Sci-fi/action/thriller:

* **Spectral.** A DARPA research is flown in to Moldova during a conflict in the country to provide his knowledge on one of the pieces of equipment he created which was issued to some soldiers. In that equipment, there are sightings of these strange humanoid things and soon, the force of soldiers he is with now has to fight to save their lives against enemies which can't be stopped with conventional firepower.

Sci-fi/action/war (with some elements of drama):

* **Battle: Los Angeles.** This is primarily an action movie with a sci-fi setting, but it still is a sci-fi movie and it does a good job at being entertaining. After aliens launch a coordinated invasion of Earth, a Marine platoon is sent on a mission to rescue civilians trapped behind enemy lines.
* **The Tomorrow War (this has more of drama as a genre than Battle: Los Angeles).** Yes, I am aware that The Tomorrow has a number of flaws, and there are a number of areas that I'd change, but it's still entertaining. In the future, aliens have invaded Earth and humanity is pushed back to the brink, and some soldiers are sent back to gather support in what to us (at the time) was the present. Once the soldiers from Earth's militaries are not enough, a draft is issued to make up for the high number of casualties and the main character of the film is drafted.

Sci-fi/thriller/action/adventure/drama/disaster:

* **Greenland.** A comet is heading straight for Earth, and a structural engineer is in a race against time to reach his family, and for them to then get to safety.

Sci-fi/thriller/drama (with some action):

* **Prospect.** A father and daughter go on a mission to harvest precious stones on an alien world, however it soon turns into a fight for their survival. This film is also a good example of how a quality film can be produced with a budget of less than 4 million dollars, and I have seen sci-fi films with significantly higher budgets which are much worse than this film.

Sci-fi/action/adventure:

* **Rim of the World.** Four misfit teens who were at a summer camp are forced by circumstance to work together to transport the key to defeating the alien invasion. This is more of a 'kid' movie than the other films, but it's still what I'd say is a hidden gen sci-fi film.","The Darkest Minds, The 5th Wave, Awake, Extinction, Spectral, Battle: Los Angeles, The Tomorrow War, Greenland, Prospect, Rim of the World"

The Man from Snowy River is based on a ballad poem written by Banjo Patterson in 1890. It is a masterpiece , iconic in Australian literature. The movie is faithful to the story, (which is not terribly complicated) but filmed in the stunning scenery of the Snowy Mountains with horseback riding that will take your breath away. Jack Thompson, Kirk Douglas, Terence Donovan, Sigrid Thornton all play wonderful characters. The young man on horseback was played by Tom Burlinson.

My favourite Aussie films of all time:

The Castle (1997) super dry. Probably the most Australian movie in existence. I watch it every Australia Day to remind me of home since I live abroad. Also Eric Banner's first ever movie but a small part.

The Dish (2000) also very dry. About Australia's part in the first moon landing. Sam Neil!

Two Hands (1999) a bit like like Lock Stock/Snatch. Early Heath Ledger break out movie for us, came out about the same time as 10 Things.

Dirty Deeds (2002) also a bit like Lock Stock/Snatch. American Mafia (John Goodman) comes to Australia to make a deal with Australian Gangsters. Brian Brown (who I always viewed as our Michael Caine) is always so great.

Romper Stomper (1992) early Russel Crowe, maybe his breakout movie. Australian neo Nazis. It is very full on. Think Train Spotting or A Clockwork Orange.

Chopper (2000) Eric Banner's breakout movie playing an infamous Aussie gangster/killer named Chopper Reed. Extremely dark comedy biopic (cause the real guy is fucking crazy but also a larikan).

Crackerjack (2002) funny silly movie about a guy who joins a lawn bowls club so he can use their parking to get to work.

The Nugget (2002) another funny silly movie about some guys who find a huge gold nugget

I'll agree with Tron: Legacy.  The visuals are awesome, and Daft Punk did the soundtrack.  They also make a cameo in the bar fight scene, and I love that as soon as the fight starts, they look at each other and change from a chill beat to something more worthy of a bar fight.  

I think the movie is underrated.

As far as thematically, BR2049 is an outstanding sequel and fits into the original sci-fi genre nicely. However, I think the two movies are vastly different. Similar themes, atmosphere, and adventure storyline; beyond that I believe BR2049 far outshines the original in terms of world-building and story progression. It's my favorite movie.

If nothing else, you're signing yourself up for stunning(and oscar winning) visuals, some of the most compelling acting of the last decade, and an engaging story from start to finish. It's not everyone's cup of tea, granted. I'd say go into it with an open mind and appreciate what Villeneuve brings to the franchise, if you enjoyed his other works I think you'll love this. I personally think it's his magnum opus; and there's a reason it has gained a cult following along with a reputation of being so underrated.

* **Extreme Job (South Korea)** \- *Action / Comedy* \- South Korean flick that is the #2 on it's all time box office. Cops buy a failing chicken restaurant opposite the drug lord's den, for stakeout purposes. Except ... on of the cops can actually cook ... 
* **Train to Busan (South Korea)** \- *Drama / Horror* \- one of the best Zombie flicks you'll watch
* **Notting Hill** \- *Rom Com* \- The friend group gives me life, there are hard issues, they have memorable lines and catch phrases and there's also one of the best endings of any rom com.
* **Game Night** \- *Drama / Comedy* \- based on the premise this had no business being as good as it is. Great ""couple"" movie too. 
* **Dangal** \- *Sports Drama* \- Based on a true story, a father who is disappointed he has no sons to pursue his dream of Olympic gold realizes ... there are also gold medals in women's sports. It's on Netflix

""The Adjustment Bureau"" and ""In Time"" are pretty good Sci fi romance drama films. The Adjustment Bureau is more focused on the ""defying fate"" aspect of romantic drama, with the Sci Fi taking a bit of a back seat in the sense that the film doesn't really develop how it works iirc. In Time is I think a nice even blend of Sci fi, action, and romance. It's also reflective of real life issues involving crime/corruption among the rich, the economy, and the law.

From Hell(2001), is an adaptation of a comic book about the Jack The Ripper case. I've heard the film is quite inaccurate, but I found it to be an enjoyable mix of fiction, drama, and true crime. There's a bit of romance thrown in but not too prominent iirc.

Maybe itâs just me, after all humor is subjective, but I just donât find people saying a silly word to make other people scared or hurt or whatever the feeling it gives you is funny. It just feels kinda random and out of place in a movie with otherwise top tier laugh out loud comedy. But Iâm sure it was hilarious in the 70s.

Rented Planes Trains and Automobiles in High School. Watched it with a buddy. We were both laughing so hard and loud that when we were done my parents were asking what the heck we had been watching. Immediately watched it a 2nd with my parents. I've always been a fan of both Steve Martin &amp; John Candy. Together they were absolutely hilarious.

You are right, a first time watcher wouldnât necessarily finish in Bruges and feel
Light-hearted. But I think it *is* a comedy around mortality. I just think it has such a tight script (apart from a couple of sloppy lines when the movie slows around the middle), and the chemistry between Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes is as good as Iâve seen.

Itâs also a film that is much funnier around subsequent views where youâre less worried around wondering about the backstory and able to pay full attention to a script that is chock-full of clever foreshadowing and downright hilarious throw away lines (âlike Tottenham!â)

Check out the movie ""**Comet**"" with Justin Long and Emmy Rossum. (2014). My wife and I found this movie by accident on Netflix a few years back and we LOVED IT. We have since watched it probably 5-6 different times. It's shot a little differently than your regular romance movie, and it's very smart and dialog driven, but I think that's what makes it so entertaining and re-watchable. I love it and can't recommend it enough! 

I don't think it's streaming anywhere so you'll probably have to pay for the rental either on Google Play, Apple TV, or Amazon Prime. 

If you end up checking it out, reply to this comment later on and let me know if you enjoyed it or not. 

Another three great ones that flew a little under the radar are ""**About Time**"" and ""**Celeste and Jesse forever**"" (though this one isn't necessarily about complete strangers meeting, it is a fun rom-com with a surprisingly sad ending) and ""**The five year engagement**"".

Good luck and enjoy!

*Wiseguy* -- show, not a movie. Might be something you'd enjoy. There's bosses, goons, retired mobsters, an undercover agent. Definitely worth a try.

One of my favorite films!

To clarify, by ""exploitation"" do you mean sexual assault, or more broadly taking advantage of another person for sex (consensual or nonconsensual)?

""Benny Loves You""

Don't watch the trailer. It will spoil great things. (As do all trailers now-a-days)

But I randomly came across the movie ""Benny Loves You"" on Hulu and watched it with some friends because we were in a ""Fuck it, let's watch something completely random that looks ridiculous based only on the cover picture.""

Wow.

What a diamond in the rough. This was great!

It's a low budget Indy British comedy horror and I personally think they did amazing with it.

To summarize it, it's essentially of you took the movies Ted, Brave Little Toaster, and Child's Play and kinda mushed them all in to an insane but super fun movie.

I have watched it several times already showing friends and family. They all thought it was great.

P.S. I'm not your mom. Watch the trailer if you want. I just have found MASSIVELY higher enjoyment from movies ever since I have avoided watching them when I can

P.S.S. I'm sorry if I've over-hyped this and you are disappointed and angry afterwards. Please forgive me. I'm just excited to share this movie because to me, it is EXTREMELY high on my favorites list.

P.S.S.S. I hope by asking for movie suggestions, you also wanted a book. Cause I wrote you one &lt;3

EDIT: Sorry for creepin but I was browsing your post history to see if I could get a feel for your personality on if I think I made a good suggestion and I noticed you might be an aspiring film maker? This is the directors (who is also the main character) first movie. They filmed it in his friends house and had lots of help from friends and family.

&gt;Near a gray and unnamed city is the Zone, a place guarded by barbed wire and soldiers, and where the normal laws of physics are victim to frequent anomalies. A stalker guides two men into the Zone, specifically to an area in which deep-seated desires are granted.

IMHO required viewing.

&gt;What I like about them is that these films have room for my thoughts. Silence and strong imagery make them authentic without an imposed version of what's going on.

It also sounds like you would really like the last 4 films of Bela Tarr. I'd recommend

* [*Werckmeister Harmonies*](https://letterboxd.com/film/werckmeister-harmonies/) (2000) a circus attraction disturbs the order of a rural town. If you like that and have a spare 7.2 hours, [*Satantango*](https://erboxd.com/film/satantango/) (1994) is a gliding odyssey into a world bereft of beauty

Some other options that occur to me:

* [*Dead Man*](https://letterboxd.com/film/dead-man/) (1995) in some ways a revisionist Western *Enter the Void*
* [*Holy Motors*](https://letterboxd.com/film/holy-motors/) (2012) What if ""all the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players"" was quite literally true?
* [*Songs from the Second Floor*](https://letterboxd.com/film/songs-from-the-second-floor/) (2000) slowly conveyed vignettes, surreal and darkly comedic
* [*Beau Travail*](https://letterboxd.com/film/beau-travail/) (1999) simmering jealousy, the male form, in the desert of Djibouti

The  original 1979 version of Phantasm is highly stylized sci-fi/horror with not too much dialog. It has imagery that stays with you And long sequences where the foley work takes the auditory lead.

You might enjoy The City of Lost Children (1995) and/or Delicatessen (1991). Theyâre both from Juneau &amp; Caro, so if you enjoy one please check out the other. All dialog is in French, and many actors are traditionally trained clowns or other street performers. Both films take place in dark fantasy worlds.

Do you like animation? Robot Carnival (1987) is an anime anthology collection from back when it was all hand drawn work.

The Shining (1980) is both extremely stylized and atmospheric.

David Bowie is wonderful as an alien in The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976).

Titus (1999) has more dialog than you might want - itâs an adaptation of Shakespeareâs âTitus Andronicusâ - but it also sports a stellar cast and absolutely beautiful design throughout.

Nobody is a must see. Made by the same guy who brought you John Wick, and it shows. More comedic, however.

Polar is also very similar, and also made by the same guy IIRC. Much darker, though.

Definitely the 2017 King Arthur movie. That one goes ***so fucking hard***, it's insane and I love it. 

You say Conan, but have you seen the 2011 movie? I thought it was far better than the original. 

On a similar note, Solomon Kane is brilliant. Based on the stories by Robert E. Howard, the same author as Conan.

Both Sin City movies are fantastic and full of badass shit. That goes for most Robert Rodriguez movies, too. I'd especially recommend Machete Kills. It's just complete, over the top, gonzo insanity.

You might like Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. It's surprisingly good, with a lot of great action scenes.

Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (animated) is I think the best Batman movie made. Also check out the other animated DC movies; they're baffalingly better than one would assume. 

Crank is one hell of a trip. Probably the best Jason Strathum movie. Just nonstop, balls to the wall action.

The Crow is extremely badass in tone, but there's not a lot of action in the movie. Still worth watching.

Vanishing Point might also really appeal to you, though again, it's not got a lot of action. The sheer badassery is palpable, however.

And to wrap it all off.... pretty much any Clint Eastwood movie? If I had to recommend just one, I'd go with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. But they're all gems of badassery.

Everything everywhere all at once (2022) hate to be the guy who recommends it all the time, but itâs genuinely badass.

Sherlock Holmes (2009) I think itâs pretty badass the way he examines fights, and executes it perfectly (most of the time) the sequel is also worth watching.

Extraction with Chris Hemsworth is what youâre looking for. One of my favorites. The rest has been mentioned throughout the post. 


Another fun movie is Bullet Train. Gray Man is fun too. Also, with Ryan Gosling, is Drive. 

Notable mention is the movie Death Sentence. 

The older Punisher movie with Thomas Jane is good entertainment. 


Ones to re-mention though are Denzelâs Equalizer movies for sure. The newer Mission Impossible movies. Taken. While perhaps not a good representation of Jack Reacher, but still entertaining in my opinion, is Tom Cruiseâs Jack Reacher. 300 is a good movie. 


For tv shows, if youâre interested, Iâd suggest Banshee, Warrior, Reacher, and Gangs of London.

This is kinda embarrassing to talk about but I'm homeless. I'm also an opioid addict. Whenever I'm coming off a binge or can't find dope though I always have somewhere to go for a few days: the hospital. 

What I do is swallow a razor or anything else made of metal that will show up on an x-ray, and go to the er. I tell them I was drinking with some friends and one of them bet me I couldn't do it. Once they see the x-ray as proof, they admit me and give me all the pain meds I want. I say I'm allergic to morphine so they either have to give me fentanyl or Dilaudid. Sometimes they want to do a scope but I'm cool with that because it means more drugs. Now I'm not saying all of this to brag, I'm saying it because I want to document the process. I really think that if it's done the right way it's something people would watch. Ive tried filming it myself but it's hard because I have trouble filming as the one beeing seen by the doctor. 

If anyone is a film student or film maker and would like to help or has any ideas, hmu.

If you only know what exists in the absolute mainstream this year (for example) a movie like âBarbarianâ would be âhiddenâ to you. If you know a little more about horror, and actually seek it out, maybe you wonât know âMolochâ or âThe Innocents.â

Itâs always impressive to watch professional performers, on a soundstage, interacting seemingly without effort. Movies can show close-ups, allowing the actors to show nuances of emotion, and even from time to time having a bit of fun with their respective roles. Naturally, it helps to have talented writers to keep up the pace of dialog.

The cast members of **Choose Me** were either experienced professionals, or talented beginners. They play off on each other with wit and energy. The âplotâ, such as it is, exists to poke fun at life: women, men, relationships, truth, lies, Californians, the French. Itâs all very clever.

But itâs not obviously comedic: no pratfalls, no slapstick, no coffee sputtering. You have to pay attention or youâll miss the jokes (or, sadly, misunderstand the movie as a drama.).

Thereâs lots of commentary on *letterboxd*.

Enjoy.

Came here for Martha Marcy May Marlene, which is an astoundingly brilliant film (IMO)

And I will add The Master (2012), also brilliant but really depressing. And one of Philip Seymour Hoffmanâs last works, RIP.  Basically a takedown of a proxy L. Ron Hubbard.

It's not a film but the game Far Cry 5 could be up your ally. A commentary-free Let's Play video of the main missions should be easy to find.

Disclaimer: a lot of fans of the series and fans of action games in general didn't receive it too well but I loved it. I was left unpacking it for a long time afterwards. Great characters and very immersive setting.

[George's Intervention](https://reelgood.com/movie/george-a-zombie-intervention-2009) is a zero budget zombie film that is just plain great.  Its low budget shows through in a lot of ways, but every one of us that watched it loved it.

[Hawk and Rev: Vampire Slayers](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/hawk-and-rev-vampire-slayers) - Fun B movie horror comedy.  Follows a security guard with ptsd and his vegan pacifist friend as they attempt to stop a coven of vampires who have invaded their town.

[Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/sundown-the-vampire-in-retreat) - A bunch of hillbilly vampires just want to be left alone to drink their fake blood in peace.  Bruce Campbell and David Carradine star in this campy vampire flick.

[Killer Klowns from Outer Space](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/killer-klowns-from-outer-space) - Truly excellent indie horror film. No sex, but does have a see through nightgown at one point and a comedic obviously fake pair of naked breasts.

**The Voices** with Ryan Reynolds (2014) is a horror comedy, but the comedy is on the darker side just in case that matters or not. It's a decent watch if you're really fishing for something new. Not a great movie, but definitely not a bad one. 

Good luck and enjoy!!

Nightbreed. Make sure you watch the Director's Cut though. 

Very intentionally schlocky but not in wink-wink type of way. Not a horror COMEDY exactly, but the silliness (especially of the sheriff character) definitely made me laugh.

The book is also great. Clive Barker's work tends to be a bit more gothic, but this one is his most self-aware, horror for the sake of fun type of story.

The Zealand-made *Housebound* (2014) is light on gore, and is a fun horror-comedy. Its lead characters are a mother, and her early twenties daughter. If you watch just the first scene of the movie, I think you'll get a good idea of where it's going. (no sex scenes, either)

If you can find it--and I have no idea where to find it--I think you'll enjoy it. Everyone I recommend it to seems to enjoy it. If you see it and like it, please let me know.

I see Evil Dead has been mentioned. I really don't like gore--I would never go see a slasher pic. But *Evil Dead II* (1987) is so over the top and cheezy in it's violence and gore that I find myself laughing out loud each time I watch it.

I've never seen the original *The Evil Dead* (1981), but from what I understand it doesn't have the same ""Let's make fun of the horror genre, on a miniscule budget"" vibe as *ED II*

this is really interesting because i think horror done well has humor in it. It doesn't have to be 2 hours of broad slapstick humor, but can be nuanced.

For example, i was watching the original poltergeist. the first 20 min of the movie, has some great classic comedic bits that nobody really talks about and notices. as a viewer it brings the audience closer to the characters, you let your guard down and you truly love the family, by the time all the mayhem begins. i dont know of any other movie that does this so well. they are able to make you laugh as well as X in your pants.

I have a similar kinda job and have been just watching whatever random movies I could find for free on youtube. Some of the ones I watched:

- Mystics in Bali (1981) - Indonesian horror movie with a floating head that goes around eating babies.

- The Intruder (1962) - William Shatner goes to a small southern town and tries to incite a race war.

- Pale Blood (1990) - Neon-drenched detective movie with vampires. 

- Framed (1990) - insanely laid back crime thriller about forging counterfeit paintings.

- The Flying Luna Clipper (1987) - A very trippy japanese computer-animated flick about a bunch of anthropomorphic objects riding a magic airplane to Hawaii.

Unfortunately I can't link them due to the sub's rules but I believe most of them are still uploaded

I don't think your reaction to Citizen Kane is unusual. I still don't like that movie. Don't understand the praise. Super unrelatable. Not a fan of the story or characters.

**Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid** (1969) *is an American classic. Still holds up today.*

**Casablanca** (1942) *is an American classic worth considering.*

**A Fistful of Dollars** (1964) *is good, especially if you liked Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry. I prefer this one to **The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly** *which is also an American classic.*

**The Sting** (1973) *is another Paul Newman Robert Redford Classic*

**Rebel Without a Cause** (1955) *is stylistically iconic.*

**Bringing Up Baby** (1938) *is hilariously loveable.*

**Harold and Maude** (1971) *you might enjoy a lot. Awesome soundtrack of Cat Steven's/Yusuf's music*

**What's Up Doc** (1972) *or other earlier Peter Bogdanovich films are quite nice. Visually. Some consider this one a love letter to* **Bringing Up Baby**

Wish you the best. Hope you find something that scratches an itch or brings you Joy :)

Nothing But Trouble. I'm a legitimate fan.

As a comedic send-up of Texas Chainsaw Massacre-style horror, and as a companion piece to films like 'Beetlejuice', 'The Frighteners', and 'Army of Darkness' (which were clearly in vogue at the time), it's incredibly effective and endlessly entertaining. Effort visually bleeds off the screen in every shot; it looks like every penny of its $40 million budget. 

It's pure Aykroydian madness at its finest.

It's also grotesque and random as all get out, which was what stuck with most, it seems.

13th Warrior If you mean critical response. It has a 33% rotten tomatoes and I recall when it came out I avoided it because of bad reviews. 

Wish I didnât! I rewatch it probably twice a year. Itâs not a bad movie I just happen to like, I actually think itâs really good! Has one of the coolest ways Iâve seen anyone figure out a new language in film. I love the music of this movie, the fun action scenes, the overall tone. Yeah you could nitpick a ton but itâs just âgood solid funâ movie. Iâd take this over the assembly line of film sequels and franchises we get today.

Iâd kill for a proper 4K of this. Hell it didnât even get a blu ray in the US. Iâm still watching my dvd copy for like 15 years.

*Vidocq* (Pitof).

Not seen it since it came out, and I was young, so I suppose the mad editing, the vulgar fish-eye-close-ups shots, the old digital cinema lookn and the uneven acting would seem very agressive to me now.

But I totally fell in love with the universe back then, with the look of it, the concept, the script mixing the real history (the revolution taking place, Vidocq himself) with fantasy elements, etc. I didn't dare to say to anyone at the time I loved the film, because everyone found it so bad. The film had a very big influence on me and my own creations.

And also *Armageddon*, which I loved so much back then. I still love Michael Bay's style (and the patriotic thing is so much over-the-top it becomes almost not a problem, more like a folkloric thing). But now i think i would find the editing far too fast and damaging the mise en scene.

I went to Letterboxd to see if there were any genuinely unpopular movies I rated highly, and hereâs what I found:

Slice (2018) - horror comedy directed by Austin Vesely.  Truly donât get why itâs hated.

The New Mutants (2020) - the semi-shelved X-Men project that got super delayed when Disney bought Fox.  I think it was a victim of expectations.

Deep Impact (1998) - people genuinely like Armageddon more than this?

Final Girl (2015) - Abigail Breslin stars as a typical horror movie final girl and turns the tables on the killers.  Clearly very low budget, but I think it works.

Battle: Los Angeles (2011) - I wonât defend this one too much, but I enjoyed it, and I guess no one else did.

Don't know how much it was hated by the audience, but a part of the specialized cinema press was in love with it back then (check for instance [this 2013 Cahiers du cinema cover](https://i.imgur.com/VlETYXO.png)).

EDIT: to give an example of how much some critics were into it, here is the excerpt of an article from a french cinema magazine close to *Cahiers* editorial line when the film came out (I tried to translate it the best I could, with the help of DeepL):

&gt; To the emptiness of the dominant images, *Spring Breakers* does not oppose any antidote: on the contrary, it piles up these images until they are saturated, proceeding by decoction to bring their radical nihilism to the surface  (...). The cyclic and nauseating time of *Spring Breakers* (repetitive by nature, the film is punctuated by incessant flashforwards that complete the film's great loop), is the one already announced in the 50's by Brando's ""We just go!"" in *The Wild One*, to portray a youth let loose at full speed on a road without horizon. To go nowhere, but to go fast, was then as much a romantic moral (for the youth for whom these new films were officially intended) as a tragic and worried statement (for the adults whose voice they also carried). (...) What is left of this romanticism when youth is subjected to the advertising reign, henceforth without sharing, of the ideology of youth? A silly stammer, a terrible vacuity flooded with colors, which ""Spring Breakers"" mourns at the same time as it celebrates, because Korine understood that the images of the time were worth all the comments on the images of the time. Images are all there is left in *Spring Breakers*, which spreads like a morbid and endless dream. The American dream of course (...), to which Korine, moralist but not sanctimonious, does not oppose any nightmare since the nightmare is there, everywhere (...), entirely contained in the seaside dream of spring break where the girls escape from a reality that, subtly, the film will never show. And in fact, there is nothing left to show, nothing here has survived the enchanted and morbid reign of images.

Another is FunHouse. While there's some conflicting logic as it goes along, I think it's overall a good movie, and I sure as hell didn't see the last scene coming. It's rare that movies pull one over on me, and that one did it. The characters are unique relative to each other, the idea is messed up enough to be appealing (if you're into horror movies), the graphics are good.

Vampire's Kiss. It's a Nic Cage film where he slowly believes he is turning into a vampire. The film maybe isn't great, but it is enjoyable. And I believe Cage acts brilliantly in this film. It's a strange performance, done deliberately. If you enjoy a more meta take on acting you might enjoy this. It also has some very funny moments, even if many are unintentional. And lots of meme-able moments.

Outland (1981) is a sci-fi remake of High Noon set on a mining colony on a moon of Jupiter, starring Sean Connery. The FX are dated but it didnât need much. 66% on IMDb and 48/100 on metacritic. Itâs a great premise and Connery is pretty great for the role of the only honest Marshall standing up against a drug smuggling conspiracy. I could see a remake starring someone like Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington being a solid thriller.

Deep Impact and Amageddon were both terrible, for very different reasons. 

True story: 

Deep Impact's director was Mimi Leder, who'd made her name directing a lot of episodic TV. Of particular note, she was a regular director for ER (George Clooney, Juliana Marguilies, etc).

While doing the VFX for the film, she was asked her opinion of a certain way shot was laid out, and her reply was ""Oh, you guys figure that stuff out. I'm not really a visual person...""

Now, what she MEANT was, she was a director that was much more about the actors and performances (as a TV drama director naturally would be). But it sort of points to the issue at heart. They were exactly opposite movies about the 'same' thing. Amageddon was all spectacle (as are all Michael Bay joints) and any 'humanity' ended up laughable, while Deep Impact had no idea how to handle the spectacle at all, and ends up reading, well, like a TV drama with a lot of expensive FX sequences interrupting the plot every so often.

source: I worked on the effects for Deep Impact. I heard the quote with my own ears.

This movie is very much like a comic. Comic books are almost always silly, convoluted, and a little hokey and cheesy. Comic movies could use more out there silliness.

Weyland never cared about the scientific integrity of the mission. The whole thing was a cover for him to go into space to meet an Engineer. 

I always felt that he packed the team with idiot scientists that no one would miss if the mission went sideways. 

I donât think itâs ever explicitly said, but even the first time I saw it, that was the vibe I picked up from the mission brief scene. They didnât bring the caliber of scientists you would normally have chosen for the job.

I honestly think that Uwe Boll's ""Postal"" is a great film. It's no masterpiece, but it's a thoroughly entertaining and really funny comedy that perfectly captures the spirit of the source material. It's edgy, but not for the sake of sticking it up to the man and being anti-PC, but because that's what the game was all about. It's funny and dumb, with some sincerely great jokes, lots of self-awareness and meta jokes, and some beautifully over the top performances. It's probably the best video game adaptation, but that bar wasn't too high anyway. While Uwe Boll is not a good director, I don't think that he deserves the title of worst director and I wish that he would have made some more black comedies. But it feels weird to claim that this film might be the best video game adaptation, because it's made by the same guy who made an active effort to lower that bar with his career.

Dark City, for me. Got largely overlooked (mostly due to the ""mainstream"" Matrix movie and even got called derivative of it). The cast and performances  were amazing, the story was well put together, even though there was the typical studio interference with it. Thankfully a lot of that was resolved with the eventual release of a Directors Cut. Scifi, noir, mystery, spiced with just enough horror. It just ticked all the boxes for me, even more so than The Matrix did. I love both movies, but Dark City edges to the top on my list.

I really liked The Village too, although (or possibly because) it had a very similar plot to a book I read in middle school. Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix. Itâs pretty much the exact same set up: an isolated town supposedly in the 1800s where the adults know the truth but the kids have no idea. The difference is that they actually are being watched all the time. When the kids start dying of diphtheria, a mother sends her daughter out into the real world for help. Most of the book is about how she experiences the outside world. I remember it being very good and suspenseful, but I was in the target age group when I read it. I donât know how it would hold up now.

I remember in CBR they did a review on record of ragnarok and complained that it was ""Not feminist enough"". Most news media outlets are extremely bad when it comes to opinions.

Right??? I just don't get why so many people loath it. The only thing I can think is maybe it doesn't emulate the video games well, but I haven't played the games so I don't know too much about that. I think I heard that originally the father was the one trying to save the daughter, but that's about it. Idk I think the visuals are great. The movie got me INTO watching playthroughs of the games.
