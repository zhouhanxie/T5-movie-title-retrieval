During Depp vs. Heard trial, there was plenty of mentioning about Amber's friends living rent-free; doing drugs and travelling on holidays on private planes, etc., all paid for by Johnny. Now non of them are friends with Amber anymore... I guess no more free stuff.Are there any movies dealing with Hollywood celebrity freeloaders? All I can remember is Entourage (TV Series 2004â2011). Similar post on r/TelevisionSuggestions asking for tv shows.

I love superhero movies, it's my favorite genre. I've seen more than I can count, but most of them seem to be Marvel or DC. (I have seen some stuff that aren't from those two though).Don't get me wrong I love Marvel and DC, but all their movies feel the same (with some being different here and there).What I'm trying to say is, I wanna see some superhero stuff that hasn't come from those two studios, or, at least, something from those franchises that feels different from the bunch. So in a nutshell, can I have some superhero movies/shows that aren't DC or Marvel?

Something like Taken, where Liam Neesan kills a bunch of sex traffickers. They have no name and are killed without much fanfare. Or like Iron Man or James Bond breaking into the volcano lair and killing the guards on the way in, but at least one of them is a woman, and specifically, is unnamed. The only example I can come up with is a Deadpool music parody on YouTube. Thanks.

So as the title says, Iâm on spring break and am looking to spend it watching phenomenal/near perfect movies. In the last two days Iâve seen Interstellar and Whiplash, each for the first time. It has been wonderful watching these, and both have left me stunned and in pure awe. So, Iâm looking for other classics that I may be missing. To be clear, Iâm not looking for anything specific, but instead something that you think is the pinnacle of what movies should be. Even if Iâve already seen the film, it will be nice to see what people consider to be the best of the best!

Those are my 2 fav movies &amp; I love the feeling they give me. Like crime romance that gets you a little giddy. Or with really charactery-characters if that makes sense. I know theyâre both Tarantino and I donât think Iâve seen all his films so maybe thereâs another like these that I would like . Something that doesnât take itself too seriously. I like happy endings. Gives me closure lol but doesnât have to be a happy ending, Iâm just saying. Thanks!

I liked the look of the trailer originally for Blade Runner 2049 however I never saw the original so I decided to watch it. Unfortunately, I strongly disliked it - I found it boring and dull and didnât enjoy the storyline at all. However, Iâve read the reviews for 2049 and absolutely loved Dune (2021) despite not enjoying the storyline - simply found it the best filmmaking Iâd ever seen. Based on the fact that I enjoyed neither film by Denis Villneauve, would I enjoy BR 2049? Thanks!

A film where you can see the main character stepping in to the music world and reaching rock bottom, only to get up again and beat all the odds in a great end scene.

I know there is a Sicario 2 but I am a bit bothered that Emily Blunt isn't in it as I loved her character and the role she played in the movie.

Iâm absolutely in love with these gritty types of LA films, more specifically ones that take place throughout the night and have interesting situations like the three I listed above. Itâs a pretty wide range, but I was just wondering if there were any other suggestions. Message to the King almost hit the mark here. Good dialogue is also a plus, especially if it has obscure pop culture references or conversations about the nature of the city itself. Thanks in advance!

I saw Spencer two days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. It's such a beautiful film (if you ignore the psychological thriller and all the suffering lol), I loved the cozy cinematography where everything seems to be filmed with a 16 mm camera or something. I loved the score, the production design, I mean that palace was beautiful, full of mist and surrounded by a lake, the cars, the dogs, the traditions, the Christmas feel, almost everything about that film is perfect, hell, even the trailer and the song choice were great. I think something similar could be Barry Lyndon but I think the cozy feeling is missing.Do you have any other suggestions?

Hi, there. I am looking for films with a similar vibe as /r/TheNightFeeling The subreddit description:   &gt; The Night Feeling is the thoughtful nostalgic emotions you feel when you drive alone at night or see a city skyline at dusk with the wind in your face.It's a subreddit for the feeling you get when you're lonely but peaceful, thoughtful but sad, and homesick for something you can't quite remember.Another person put it this way:&gt; It's a quiet summer night, warm outside. Warm enough to have a window open but cool enough that a hoodie is comfortable. A breeze rustles the leaves of a bush or tree outside and you feel it brush over your face. The T.V. has switched over to a test pattern or maybe static, the sound is low so you don't wake anyone else up. A single car passes by, maybe on a neighborhood street or or on a barely heard highway. The night air has a particular smell, gentle, but one that's only detectable when the rest of the world goes to sleep. You feel like you're one of only a few awake. You're alone, but not lonely. Maybe you just sit there and stare out into the night. Maybe there's a light, off toward the horizon. The world is asleep around you and you're left to wonder at the majesty of it all. You should feel tired, should want to crawl into bed under the covers but you can't tear yourself away from the night.   &gt; Or maybe you're driving down a lonely highway, deep into the night. The only illumination comes from your headlights or a passing farm. The little towns you speed through have maybe a gas station, illuminated from above, but it quickly passes beyond you and beyond your memory. The only thing that's left is the drive, long into the night, soft music playing on the radio, something indistinct. Familiar, but not.

These are the movies I've seen: https://i.imgur.com/10GPl0C.pngNot sure how true it is but it seems like American movies started truly dominating the world during the 80s. Anything released before that seems to be way less popular. My country had it worse of course, since we were on the other side of the iron curtain until 1989, but even after that, with a few exceptions, movies released before the 80s never got very popular. We have our own classics from that time and since the cultural differences used to be much bigger, people just don't enjoy these older American movies as much I guess. I also expect myself to have ""unusual"" reactions to some of these movies - for example I tried watching Citizen Cane and I could not get into it at all.

It has to be PG-13 max and she doesnât like overly action or cgi movies. She wants a movie thatâll âmake her thinkâ and has some sort of meaning behind it. Iâm tuning circles trying find one that fits the category but is also appropriate enough to watch with her. Any suggestions?

When I run out of movies to watch, I just google Oscar winning movies and that's how I've come to the conclusion that the Oscars have gone to the dogs since the last few years. So this time, I googled for movies which don't deserve the Oscar. Went through a list of movies, and I was kinda intrigued by Ordinary People. It'll be in my top 5 films along with Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society. The plot, the characters, the soundtrack, everything just fell into place. It deals with the themes of loss, guilt, depression, inability to return to normal life, and so on. I'm out of words to express how good this movie is.Even though it'd be quite frivolous debating whether it should've won the Oscar over Raging Bull (which I absolutely love), I've never felt so close to a movie before and would love if you guys can watch the movie. I'd wanna go on and on about how much I love this movie but I don't wanna ruin your experience. Please watch the movieThank you! :)

What a beautiful film. I canât think of many other movies that have had me as emotionally invested as this one. Itâs a documentary, which of course adds to the authenticity and the raw, genuine, spontaneous human emotion. Iâm nowhere near the life that these boys lived, but for 3 hours I felt that part of Chicago. The backdrop, the basketball courts, the high schools, the streets, and the people. The âcharactersâ in this are amazing, too. One of these guys is like a stereotype always talking about how great he was in high school and if it wasnât for the one thing he wouldâve went pro lol. I wonât get too into it for the sake of spoilers but you run the whole board here. Some are very likable, some not so much. Some in between, as is the way with humans. Some of the things that happen in this movie feel scripted theyâre so poignant and familiar. This movie had me throwing my arms up in the air yelling âyes!â then literally (and I donât use that word lightly) 2 seconds later clutching my head wondering what couldâve been. I almost canât watch this in its entirety. Itâs too much

Heterosexual relationship as I'm looking for something to relate to to inspire with my writing. Preferably the character with more of the coquette tendencies is the female. Someone who can turn from gentle and loving to cold. But I'm not seeking a femme fatale archetype, the female can still be good hearted and it can even be the guy who is outright evil, but that's not a requirement. I like the aesthetic of Euphoria so anything like that is a plus and I like the character Maddy and the hot and cold relationship shown there. If the movie is set in North or West Europe that would also be cool but anything will do.  And summer vibes would be nice.

Recently I watched The Last Match(1990) which is an action movie where a football team attacks a Caribbean nation to save the QBâs daughter, and John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!(1965) which was an (unfunny) political satire where a stranded Air Force pilot has to coach the football team of a Middle Eastern kingdom, and Wolfpack (1987) about a fascist high school football team. And the original Rollerball(1975) was an interesting mix of dystopian sci-fi with sports. Other films Iâve seen are Shaolin Soccer and Battlefield Baseball.Next up Iâm going to check out Alan Clarkeâs Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire, which is a horror comedy musical sports film about snooker. Or the 1970âs Canadian movie Paperback Hero about a minor-league hockey player who loses his grip on his sanity.Iâm looking for films in a similar vein, sports being mixed into other genres in unusual ways. Iâm most interested in American football, but all sports are welcome.

We weren't huge fans of A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I've seen the original Evil Dead and liked it, but that was over a decade ago, and I haven't seen the sequels. We loved Scream but we haven't seen the sequels either. I don't think of these as ""horror movies,"" which is why I didn't include them in the list, but we are huge fans of Shaun of the Dead and The Cabin in the Woods. Based on what we've already watched and what we like, are there any great, notable horror movies that would be perfect for us? If you could only pick three movies for us to watch, what are the ones that we absolutely have to see? Thanks for the help! I really appreciate it.

This is a classic of cinema that I never got around to until this winter.Set in Japan in the 8th century, a small group of men sit under the Rashomon city gate during a rainstorm.  They have just finished testifying in court about a samurai found murdered in the woods nearby.Through a series of flashbacks, the story of how the murder happened and the events surrounding it are told by different people who saw what happened.I think, for a 1950s movie, it holds up very well. The writing, acting, and cinematography are all top notch, especially considering the movie was made for $250,000.  I'd say more, but i don't want to give too much away.

My 6 year old is absolutely obsessed with musical theater. Iâm not a fan of musicals in the slightest. At this point I have seen every Disney animated musical that exists at least 10 times. Sheâs a ballerina and loves all kinds of dancing and singing so my mom decided to show her the new West Side Story because sheâs apparently trying to kill me. I have had âAmerIcaâ stuck in my head for an unspeakable amount of time. The remake isâ¦ good/okay.

Hello, I'm looking for horror/sci-fi movies where an alien/demon/parasite/bug/whatever infects someone and they get possessed/mind controlled/transformed (please don't recommend ghost/devil/vampire/zombie movies). Then the possessed ones start spreading the stuff among the protagonists one by one (not just among random characters/townfolk). Some people may escape by the end but it's preferred if everyone gets caught. I'd also like some decent onscreen effects, not just offscreen possessions.I think of movies like Infected (2002), Shadows of the Dead (2016), Demons 1/2, Night of the Demons series, The Faculty etc. Weird/hilarious stuff like Zombeavers are also fine.Thanks a lot.

A few well placed or telegraphed jumpscares are fine. As is very light kinds of non-cutting violence like possession or someone being hit or otherwise non-gorily harmed. I very much dislike animal abuse and syringes.I very much enjoyed The Lighthouse, 1922, The VVitch, The Lodgers, Signs, The Village, The Others, The Invitation, VHYes and Resolution. I like period pieces, but I don't mind a modern setting if the story is good and the atmosphere is grim.I like movies with creepy creatures or people, mysterious buildings or rooms, cosmic or subtle horror (slasher villains, not so much) and weird stuff going on whether it's due to cults, spirits or just general weirdness. If the movie conveys discomfort and despair, claustrophobia or just a general sense of dread then I'm a happy viewer. Cutting, poking or goring with sharp objects and eyegore are the big no-no's. No slashers, torture porn or body horror. I enjoy natural or contemporary or old fashioned environments, not so much spaceships or underwater bases. I'm at my wits end trying to find more like these, but the algorithms of the various streaming services just keep recommending Hereditary and the various jumpscare-heavy Blumhouse films or mediocre modern horror that's just cashing in on trends like internet horror icons or escape rooms.I've had Vivarium, Don't Scream and The Color out of Space recommended to me, but I've not yet gotten to them.Thanks and I really appreciate your suggestions!

My parents didnât do family movie nights and stuff, and I want to experience some new and old films with my preteen to give us something consistent to do together now that heâs growing up and wanting to spend more time with his friends.I was able to get him interested in reading through Harry Potter and then The Hunger Games, and weâve watched those as well. He really liked Holes and The Princess Bride. He found Jurassic Park pretty scary (I donât blame him, Iâm not a fan of jump scares either). But Iâm not a movie buff and I know that there are some fantastic coming-of-age movies that I never saw, myself.Edit: You guys are bringing in such good recommendations, thank you all so much!! Iâll keep all of them in mind and am saving this post to make a whole yearâs worth of movie nights. Weâre talking about rating them and chatting about what our thoughts are in a journal; maybe weâll share our favorites and least favorites when we finish!

Stars Chris Rock as a wannabe rapper who uses a local thugs (MC Gusto) identity and criminal background to build a reputation and sell records. Partially shot as a mockumentary, it follows the band Cell Block 4 ""MC Gusto"" ""Dead Mike"" and ""Stab Master Arson"". The rise of fame of the trio soon reaches the real Gusto (Charlie Murphy) who is incarcerated and convinced he was set-up by Rock. Pleasantly surprised how well this movie holds up.

So I am in search of some good movies regarding the western pioneer days? I just got done watching the series (1883), which was well done but left me wanting more.. I really enjoy a good western movie but I canât say that I have seen a movie about western pioneers. Any suggestions?

Yes I am late to the party but last night I watched 12 Angry Men (1957) and while I was amazed by every aspects of this wonderful film, from the cinematography to the performances, I was really amazed by Henry Fonda. I found him to be a really competent actor and I loved, loved, loved his performance. But, alas, it was the only movie I saw with him in it. So I was wondering what movie I should watch if I am really fond (no pun intended) of Fonda's performance. Thanks in advance!

I watched a few titles recently that made me realise a certain premise I enjoy. I love a movie or show with an ensemble cast, where inevitably some shenanigans ensue. Ideally, the characters are somewhat satirical interpretations of privileged people: celebrities, gen Z youth, entrepreneurs etc. For reference, I really enjoyed The White Lotus, Knives Out/Glass Onion, Bodies Bodies Bodies, The Menu, Ready or Not.Would love more recommendations along that theme!

I saw Lux Ãterna by Gaspar NoÃ© fairly recently and thought wow that's the greatest attempt at a Nine inch Nails/Rammstein/Tool concert I have ever seen in a film.   The flashing lights create a psychedelic and hallucinogenic experience that is like an epileptic orgasm.    So with that in mind I'm looking for films with intentionally intrusive audiovisual styles.  Loud metal/industrial/noise music used as background music with no band playing, strobe lights, insane fast cuts, dangerously loud noises, double exposures, extreme high contrast shots, consistent switching from color to black and white.

Please recommend me a movie similar to Prime Suspect (1991) that has a tight script and is gritty but also feels realistic when watching it. Good storytelling is a must with the procedural detective movie preferably having realistic characters with occasional humour. It doesn't have to involve a main female character dealing with sexism in the workplace, but if it does that's not an issue for me.

Iâve seen just about every movie considered scary, and nothings scared me. The last movie I watched that scared me was âa Serbian filmâ and thatâs not quite the scare Iâm looking for.

Looking for good movies involving a chase to inspect their plot!  From stuff like Catch me if you can to Run Lola Run, as soon as it mostly involves a chase from the perspective of the characters being chased.  Preferably something where multiple characters are in on escaping from whatever enemy/force follows them, imagine a prison escape film, but focused on the part AFTER they escape the prison. Stuff like that!  Do not recommend movies about THE ESCAPE, I'm looking for chases!Avoid horror and apocalypse films, as while those do technically have something chasing the characters, I'm looking from something a little less thrillery and something more adventury. Nevertheless, they are still good recommendations if they have some form of spin.

Today is such a beautiful day and I am so so grateful for my youth! I had 6 hours of sleep and still woke up fully energized, I sat at a desk for 4 hours doing office work, and went out and play 4 hours of golf walking ~2.5 miles. I then played another 2.5 hours of intense tennis. All the while I am texting a girl I am so in love with on instagram setting up a date - and itâs such a refreshing, exciting, novel feeling! And knowing that I will be okay if sheâs busy or isnât interested gives me such a strong sense of grounding. I plan to head home now and put on my new favorite songs, watch a movie until 1 or 2am then go to bed. And knowing that I will wake up tomorrow fully functional and ready to go on startup just makes me so damn happy and grateful to be young.Reddit, what are some films that are perfect for me tonight?Xoxo

I wasn't entirely sure what subreddit this would be best suited for but thought this would be a good place to start. My son is in Grade 5 now but we have been attempting to homeschool (not online learning) since the pandemic started. We've been a bit lax about how we teach certain things due to trying to work around his disabilities (he also struggled mightily with regular school before switching) so he's not entirely caught up on a lot of things that other kids his age might be. We've discussed racism with him before as well as some of the history surrounding slavery but not nearly enough for him to get a proper idea of how horrible it was/is considering we are Caucasian (Canada) and he has never been exposed to anything like it. (He's never even met someone Black before in person)He struggles with reading but we do spend the majority of our free time engrossed in movies/television since it's the one thing he really seems to connect with. He's only become accepting of watching non-animated movies/shows over the last few years but it's usually things like Marvel movies (The Black Panther is his favourite movie/superhero) or family adventure/comedies like Jumanji so this will be his first introduction to educational Movies that may not always have a happy ending but I think it might be the easiest way for him to see, understand and learn about what kind of things have happened in history. I'm fully prepared for him to not like these movies since they will be so different than what he is used to but as long as they might teach him something important that's the main goal. It will give us a place to start and open up an area for discussion if he has any questions. Thank you for taking the time to read and I appreciate any suggestions that might be given!Edit: If it helps for suggestions. We have subscriptions to Netflix, Prime and Disney+ but if any of them aren't on those, we could figure out a way to rent/buy them.

Gramps is a movie buff. He's got at least 200 VHS tapes in his office. I've been trying to get him some things he hasn't seen. He's not loving the modern stuff. I recommended The Greyhound, because he generally likes Tom Hanks, but he didn't like it. I think he rejects GCI and non-realistic storylines. I think he likes a great story, but he also likes to know what he's looking at is real. He's seen all the mainstream things. Loves Bridge Over the River Kwai and 12 Angry Men, etc. He does like some modern things like Erin Brockovitch, so it isn't the actors that bug him. If there are some realistic war or legal dramas that you can recommend, I would appreciate it. I can pretty much download and stream anything to his TV. Thanks in advance!!

Hello! I'm doing an essay on connections between fictional texts, comparing how each portrays them and what they have to say about them etc. Movies count so here I am. I've got a few connections I'm looking to make work, haven't decided which yet, but it'd help a lot to have some good suggestions. I need four that connect for an essay, here's the topics I'm thinking of:1. Artificial Intelligence2. Evil in humanity/humanity's true nature. To do with how we conceal it, what parts we should work against or not. There's an AJJ line that goes ""there's a rapist and a nazi living in my tiny heart"" that goes well for this idea. How we often pretend we don't have sexualities is a good example, doesn't have to be full hidden beast.3. Utopias. Just any movies about genuine Utopias, I'd compare what people think an ideal society looks like. 4. Control. This one would absolutely include 1984 with the whole essay in the middle explaining how Oceania works and what ""War is Peace"" means.

Extracted Movie Titles:","Hello! I'm doing an essay on connections between fictional texts, comparing how each portrays them and what they have to say about them etc. Movies count so here I am. I've got a few connections I'm looking to make work, haven't decided which yet, but it'd help a lot to have some good suggestions. I need four that connect for an essay, here's the topics I'm thinking of:
1. Artificial Intelligence
2. Evil in humanity/humanity's true nature. To do with how we conceal it, what parts we should work against or not. There's an AJJ line that goes ""there's a rapist and a nazi living in my tiny heart"" that goes well for this idea. How we often pretend we don't have sexualities is a good example, doesn't have to be full hidden beast.
3. Utopias. Just any movies about genuine Utopias, I'd compare what people think an ideal society looks like. 
4. Control. This one would absolutely include 1984 with the whole essay in the middle explaining how Oceania works and what ""War is Peace"" means. Might also include Dune Messiah with how the idea of a constitution being a powerful entity with no conscious and no one to control it is brought up. So movies that match that type of thing. 
5. Humanity's end game. Could be a different species too but just anything that talks about what humans are aiming for with all this scientific advancement, where should we try to be in 40000 years or is it just gonna get worse and we should end it now or revert to ape.

I have several days off work and Iâm feeling ready to dive into some dark things and feel the feels regarding the topics in the title. Preferably from a femme perspective but not picky. Also prefer the combo but again, a movie that handles either one authentically is great. Thank you to anyone who responds.

I find that I am increasingly bored with movies nowadays. I think I'm losing my love of films.

I want movies that make you go ""WTF did I just watch"" in any way possible whether it's because it was so bad, so confusing or best case scenario, hopefully, because you just can't believe what a masterpiece it was.

Peter Dinklage got me to give it a go and he definitely delivers. The fights are pretty good which shouldn't be surprising, not much difference between dance and fight choreography. The music is catchy, finding myself humming it out a few days later.# Don't Worry Darling (2022)Florence Pugh has been great in everything and she continues the trend. I thought Harry Styles was milquetoast as her love interest but once you get past the reveal in this mystery-thriller, he becomes far more interesting. Olivia Wilde commands a great eye as a director, I also applaud her use of herself as a literary device. Don't Worry Darling is late to the zeitgeist it is speaking about; however, that's an underdeveloped point of view. The best part is people are going to get angry at the wrong parts but that's what these 'perfect neighbour holds a secret' usually do anyway.# Fargo (1996)A simple story with simple characters would belie the genius of this dark comedy. In addition to loveable Midwestern folks, we've got some stark contrasts that show how those who dream of a bigger life end up paying a gargantuan price. On top of that, the movie is absolutely gorgeous due to how easily it reads in hard to film conditions; namely, at night or during the winter.# VHS 99 (2022)Each of the anthology is a solid banger, bringing the feels and fears of the various cultural touchstones.

#Only Discuss Movies You Thought Were Great

I define great movies to be 8+ or if you abhor grades, the top 20% of **all** movies you've ever seen. Films listed by posters within this thread receive a Vote to determine if they will appear in subreddit's [Top 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/wiki/meta/top100), as well as the ten highest Upvoted Suggested movies from last month. The Top 10 highest Upvoted from last month were:

8.|Daybreakers (2009)|72
9.|Wristcutters: A Love Story|69
10.|The Secret of Nimh (1982)|62

**Note:** Due to Reddit's Upvote fuzzing, it will rank movies in their actual highest Upvoted and then assign random numbers. This can result in movies with lower Upvotes appearing higher than movies with higher Upvotes.

What are the top films you saw in October 2022 and why?  Here are my picks:

# Barbarian (2022)

What a delightful, twisted trip. Plotwise, Barbarian takes you in so many directions that you're never allowed to get your bearings. I applaud that because the movie is not shy showing you geography, meaning you know exactly where all of the characters are at all times.

The fights are pretty good which shouldn't be surprising, not much difference between dance and fight choreography. The music is catchy, finding myself humming it out a few days later.

# Don't Worry Darling (2022)

Florence Pugh has been great in everything and she continues the trend. I thought Harry Styles was milquetoast as her love interest but once you get past the reveal in this mystery-thriller, he becomes far more interesting. Olivia Wilde commands a great eye as a director, I also applaud her use of herself as a literary device. Don't Worry Darling is late to the zeitgeist it is speaking about; however, that's an underdeveloped point of view. The best part is people are going to get angry at the wrong parts but that's what these 'perfect neighbour holds a secret' usually do anyway.

# Fargo (1996)

A simple story with simple characters would belie the genius of this dark comedy. In addition to loveable Midwestern folks, we've got some stark contrasts that show how those who dream of a bigger life end up paying a gargantuan price. On top of that, the movie is absolutely gorgeous due to how easily it reads in hard to film conditions; namely, at night or during the winter.

# VHS 99 (2022)

Each of the anthology is a solid banger, bringing the feels and fears of the various cultural touchstones. I've only skipped VHS Viral due to overwhelming negativity, I think '99 might be the best out of the entire batch aside from the second movie which is ironic given it had some of the least production time out of the entire franchise.

I just decided to let go of my childhood dream of been pursuing since I was 14 (Iâm 28 now) and pursue a new path in my life that Iâve realized is more meaningful to me. Movies always help me process big emotions and as you may expect, Iâm dealing with some big ones right now. Any suggestions of movies about letting go of dreams to follow a new path, or even letting go of a past thatâs been held on to for a long time, would be appreciated. Would like them to be optimistic/uplifting in the end. Thanks!

Same dog as The Wizard of Oz.It's an indictment on the mob justice culture of that era. It's a romance between Spencer Tracey and Sylvia Sidney. It's about gossip ruining peoples lives.

My mom and I are scary movie buffs, but it seems really hard to find an old fashioned creature feature nowadays. Psychological horror is good, but itâs not what weâre looking for (weâve seen SO MANY âafter a traumatic XYZ, so and so decides to pick up his or her life and start again, but a psychological horror is about to start!â Itâs great! But it seems everything is like that now) James Wan is our favorite director, so any movies like the Insidious series or  the Conjuring is right up our alley. Donât be Afraid of the Dark, Annabel, poltergeist, Quiet Place, are also good ones. Eg: happy family moves into house, house turns out to be haunted. Or, happy couple goes on hiking trip in the woods, weird things and creatures  ensue.

Looking for recommendations of films that creatively play with the perception of memory and time - particularly through the filmmaking technique such as editing rather than just as a subject.Ideally would also prefer lower budget or independent films rather than blockbusters, but I'm all ears to suggestions.Memento and The One I Love are two that immediately came to mind because of how they use editing to play with memory and perception, so would love to hear some more ideas in that vein.Other notable mentions are Coherence, Primer, Upstream Color, Synchronic, Resolution, Edge of Tomorrow.Appreciate any and all suggestions!

Iâm doing a 52-week watch challenge next year, and the first entry is [a Best Picture winner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture). Doesnât have to be a film that deserved to win (in fact, it may be more interesting if you DONâT think it deserved to win), but it has to be a movie that WON the Oscar for that year. Iâve seen a number of them, but Iâm curious to see what you all would suggest! Itâll help me narrow it down, at the very least, so I would love some suggestions!**EDIT**: *Wow*, this blew up a little bit! Thank you all for the suggestions! Trying to reply to people individually, but there are a lot of comments. Thus far, the top 10 suggested films seem to be *Parasite* (unsurprisingly), *Unforgiven* (which actually *did* surprise me, but fair enough), *The Deer Hunter* (gonna have to be in a specific mood for that one), *American Beauty* (all I know is the plastic bag speech, so Iâll check it out), *The Apartment* (love Billy Wilder), *No Country for Old Men* (been on my list forever), *Argo* (another surprise, but a lot of people seem to like this one), *Moonlight* (another one thatâs been on my list for a while now), and *12 Years a Slave* (I haveâ¦complicated feelings about this one; you can find out more about those in a post below, if youâre curious; still, I really need to watch it, for multiple reasons).Thank you all again! Probably wonât be the first time I post here with suggestions, so I really appreciate the help. Iâll let you know which one I choose first in a future editâ¦but *Parasite* is definitely the front-runner at the moment.

By mind blowing, I mean the vibe Shutter Island gave when you thought you knew what going on then all a sudden holy shit you were WRONG.Just that complete surprise that messes with your head and has you suddenly questioning life itself.Movies that gave me similar feelings (though maybe didnât do a complete 180) were:Donnie DarkoThe ZodiacThe Descent In The Tall Grass Night crawler (maybe this doesnât fit here but I loved the eerie atmosphere and the fact I wasnât sure what was going to happen)The Guilty (same reason as above)Also, if thereâs no sick (as in vomiting) in the movie, even better. I have a phobia of it but I know itâs not a big deal to others so you might not remember - no worries if not, I can check it myself!Thank you in advance, I havenât watched a good psychological film a while and Iâm craving one.Just a few extras:- I really like films where times sort of messed up- Iâm also really into hidden/deeper meanings time films where you feel like you come out of it with a perspective change or have you questioning reality- If nothing brings to mind, anything that has the Twilight film type of lighting will suffice lol

**What is a Retro 80s movie?**  Retro 80s movies are NOT 80s movies (I've already seen most 80s movies). RETRO means modern movies  (i.e. 2000-2022) that are set in the 80s and that pay homage to the 80s. Stranger Things is an example of this, although it's a series and not a movie.**Note:**  Movies like Dallas Buyers Club, No Country for Old Men, Wet Hot American Summer are NOT Retro 80s movies, although they take place in the 80s. They dont pay homage to the 80s. There's not a lot of focus on the clothing, music, etc. of the 80s in these films.**Examples**:  American Psycho  Take Me Home Tonight  Driven (2018)  Donnie Darko

\-The main character realizes or learns that they're on an entirely different planet, or that they're in an entirely different time than they thought

\-A movie that starts as a simple action movie but then becomes a horror movie 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I was able to give enough information to give an idea of what I'm looking for, and I hope to hear your recommendations. Thanks!!!", None

I am looking for movies with a heavy, gloomy, dark atmosphere, almost like it has a gray filter on it. Preferably a small town setting, but it's not a must. Foggy, rainy weather is a plus also. It has to have an unsettling vibe. Perfect examples for a movie like this would be: Prisoners, It follows, The Hunt, Chronicle and any Denis Villeneuve movie.

Hello, people of Reddit! I am in the mood to cry my eyes out while eating chocolate so I would like some recommendations.

Details:Hi, can you recommend to me some cheesy gothic movies, please? With graveyards, twighlight, old churches, solemn music, pale actors, historic clothes, etc etc. Doesn't matter if it's about the paranormal or not. A detective would be excellent, but it doesn't matter much.

I like the actress Emma Roberts this film of hers The Art of getting by was very nice, I liked it because the girl seems to be forgiving of the boy's inexperience. I also like Almost famous, because the girl was older and seemed like a similar scenario. The film The perks of being a wallflower was very good also... I guess I really like coming-of-age movies, like those where the boy more so seems to be a bit shy and the girl is a bit of a bad influence but is kind, or as the group of friends is a bit fun but a bad influence. Maybe highschool. I have seen licorice pizza... wasn't really a great fan of it and heard a lot of good from it, at the time it did seem like the right film type for me. We're the Millers is quite good but I'm looking for a bit more nostalgia thought-provoking, not too much comedy driven don't mind laughing though. I thought ladybird was quite a good film also. That actress seems very cute also. I think I have said all I had to spew out of me hehe. Would greatly appreciate what you guys suggest. Thanks

Expressions of sexual desire in art make me uncomfortable, and I find it difficult to find works that aren't inspired by sexual desire in some way.I don't mean works with depictions of sex, I mean works where the creator's desire influences the creation in some way, their sexual desire manifesting itself in their identity or taste.So, theoretically a movie with multiple sex scenes depicted in a relatively disinterested way could be more watchable than a movie without any explicit sexual content,  but in which in a possibly undirect way identification with a certain sexual longing is necessary to understanding, or even tolerating the work.Would anyone be able to recommend anything considering the above predicament?

Despite having a somewhat bizarre premise, this film manages to be so much more mature and smarter than it has any right to me. The animation is beautiful, the characters are lovable, relatable and fully realized (the protagonist is the best mother in anime ever), the music is great and as someone who very rarely cries at films, this one really got me. I sometimes put it on to feel something whenever I feel incapable of crying as ridiculous as that sounds. Overall, I think this is one of the best animated films ever and one that I would highly recommend.

This is a Bollywood movie/Hindi movie set in New York, and deals with the events of 9/11 and its aftermath. It's basically a story of 3 friends and how their lives change after 9/11. It's not your typical Bollywood movie, even though it does have songs. The songs serve a clear purpose in terms of exploring character arcs or driving the narrative forward.While it's a pretty straightforward thriller and some flaws like any other film, it takes a very raw and direct approach in showing the events as they happened. Some of the scenes are etched in my mind. It also provides a perspective of 9/11 from the eyes of the brown South Asian community in the US.I'd say it's definitely worth a watch, especially if you're from the West!

I'm not even sure what I'm describing, I guess it could be a movie about a single wealthy person just living their life. Maybe someone older but not old so I can avoid topics like partying and wild things like that. I'm picturing like a guy dozing off in a beach chair at a golf club that he owns just to chill and look at the grass.

I usually watch mysteries and thrillers, but I decided to check out 8th Grade last night and I loved the feeling of that movie. A real drama, not goofy or whacky, very personal and genuine. I'm looking for something like that, and it doesn't have to be about kids or coming of age. The recommended movies I've seen are Booksmart which seemed like the complete opposite, but I'll save it for when I want *that* type of comedy. And Edge of Seventeen which I would have had to rent so that's a last resort. The Florida Project felt kinda like this movie. And maybe Roma too. I've seen those. I just want to fade away into someone else's world and experience something that has meaning to it and feels very personal. Ya know, because we all lack that in our lives.

Hello, everybody!I teach ESL, and I'm teaching high school seniors this year. Most of my students have an advanced level of English, so I thought it would interesting to study cinema with them. I though it would add to the class if we could watch a short movie every class (under 15min, but preferably under 10min). We will generally be discussing the basic techniques in cinematography, a little history, and eventually they will try to make some movie analysis. They will also read *The Decay of Cinema* and *Il Maestro, Federico Fellini*, because I think it's important to address the problematic around the cultural industry. With that said, does anyone have suggestions on what short movies could be good choices to make those young minds tick? They could be mute, with dialogues in English or even just with subtitles in English. My biggest problem is that they need to be short shorts, or I'll have no class time left. I'm starting with *Arrival of a train at La Ciotat* because there's no better place to start than the beginning (and also because that is a reference they already know and can talk about).

My dad is in hospice, and can't follow complex movies anymore. Last week we watched The Great Escape and Rear Window which he really enjoyed. I think they went over well because he can remember the plots, and didn't't have to worry too much about following the dialogue, the music does the heavy lifting. I'm trying to think of other old movies that are pretty chill, with no kids (makes him sad), and not too many explosions (so he can sleep through them if he wants).

The final showdown isn't between a hero and a villain in a burning building or a rooftop, it's in a nondescript warehouse where someones parked a car underneath a mech. There's no sylised action or gun-fu.The fate of the worlds not at stake, it's just a bunch of cops working a case.I'm looking for something with that specific type of verisimilitude.

That one scene where she's feeding her captive her vomit was disgusting, it was amazing. Honestly more potent than any gore scene I can recall. I had a similar feeling in ' The Eyes of My Mother' (2017) with all of the intimate scenes of our main character feeding her captive.

I'll start off by saying that these movie recommendations do not have to be super hero movies! Dark Knight Rises - fucking love this movie mainly because of the constant changes between Imax and non imax(?). The Amazing skyline shots, the color scale of the movie, and just the way it looks in general. I also love Bane and his voice.The Batman (2022) (POTENTIAL SPOILERS) I won't say too much because I could talk for a while about this movie but I LOVED how to took Batman and turned him back into this scary figure. The use of eerie music through the film reaaaaly adds to it. Also the way this film looks is fucking bonkers. Crazy textures and crazy lighting.Tragedy of Macbeth (2021)- I love language and the ways language can be used when trying to convey a message. This movie is not only full of dense language with so much symbolism, but it's entirely black and white with incredible set designs. I love the ""emptiness"" and ""eerieness"" this movie provides and would love more like it.Blade Runner 2049 - jeez. All I have to say is give me more neon cyberpunk movies that arent a 2/10 PLEASE.This post might be a little all over the place but thanks in advance!

People are out of touch and are submerged into their screens not realizing that their loved ones are right beside them. Three stories takes place simultaneously with different plots and are surprisingly linked with eachother as the movie progresses.The movie tries to stress the point about how internet, along with being helpful also is destroying today's youths and even adults. It's a must watch if you are a fan of depressing and surreal plotlines.The ending was amazing and Disconnect beautifully illustrates the term 'loss of touch in modern civilization'.

Basically Iâm looking for movies that have an innocent and light hearted feel that doesnât have that sort ofâ¦contrived Hallmark movie style, forced family-friendly and all cheese, not great writing. Which is depressing because that kind of suggests âhappiness = stupid / angst = clever writingâ.I would prefer one where not ALL the focus is put on a love story - it doesnât have to exclude that, but Iâd like an actual plot or character development outside of romance. But made for adults. Think Amelie I guess.Ensemble casts would probably work for this, but most Iâm finding when I look are either love stories, depressing (family dramas, action, crime), or have that badly written cheese factor which yeah can be fun but not what Iâm looking for.Thanks if anyone knows

Hi there. Iâm looking for other classic films with a theme of heavy heartbreak, particularly if thereâs a lot of melodramatic dialogue. The sadder the better. Last year I was looking for some dialogue for audio sampling on the theme of heartbreak and thatâs how I found Brief Encounter, and not only was it a brilliant film, but the dialogue gave me exactly what I was looking for. So looking for more in that vein. Would prefer films that are pre-1960, but open to some exceptions. Thanks so much!

Directed by Ralph Bakshi. Adult animated film about four generations of an immigrant family whose lives parallel the history of American popular music, from burlesque shows to Jazz to Rock. Animation mostly consists of rotoscoping. I enjoyed this movie very much, the only quibble being that the rotoscoped animation may dip into the uncanny valley at times. Nevertheless, I found it a visual marvel with an excellent soundtrack.

Hello everyone.I have a little brother who's really bitter and ungrateful. He doesn't seem to appreciate what he has and acknowledge his role in determining the quality of his experience! I don't feel that arguing with him will do anything but make him resist more to change, so I thought maybe a movie can help him change his mind and see things from this viewpoint.So I need you guys' help with this :) Any suggestions are very appreciated. P.S. If you think more info on him is needed to make a decision, although that's probably impossible, here's more : He turned 14 the other day, and is a very good looking and healthy young boy. He's smart, but isn't doing very well at school. And as you'd probably expect, he spends a lot of time playing video games, and there really isn't many better (fun) things for him to do around here.

I  watched The Old Guard, Age of Adaline, Forever (2014-15), and I am  about to watch some other immortal movies that I found suggestions on.  So far, on all the movies I have seen, the movies seem to focus a lot on  the negative side, the ""curse"" of being immortal, where as I want to  see death being portrayed as the curse, not the lack of it.I liked  in Age of Adaline the fact that she knew many languages, knew how to a  lot of things well because of the time she had to learn it all. I didn't  like the ending all that much, made me tired of this perspective that  is always portrayed in stuff like this, so that's why I'm writing this  post.A video from CGP Grey called ""Why Die?"" will perhaps make it a bit clearer for you what perspective I'm looking for in a movie/tv show - sorry, can't put a link here or the post gets removed.Like, how cool would it be if you could master every skill, learn every language, experience a life in every country, watch humanity progress through thousands of years, explore space for milions of years.TL;DR: A movie that looks at immortality and the opportunities it brings in a mostly optimistic positive way. EDIT: I am 15 minutes into The Man From Earth and it looks like the kind of thing I have been looking for so far, but please if you know of any others, I would appreciate it.EDIT: The Man From Earth - it was beautiful, well thought out.

Hello! Iâm in a book club and every December we pick a movie instead. Iâd love to suggest some movies that are fantastic films, but also lead to some interesting conversations if anyone has any ideas? Last year we watched Hugo and it didnât lead to any interesting insights. Our group tends to like mythology or fantasy when weâve read them, but weâve enjoyed comedy and drama as well. Winter setting would be a plus. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this!

Yes, this is a challenge. I have watched many movies over my short life and the few that made me cry, I will list below. I recently, not so recently watched Marley and me with a friend. Didn't she'd a tear. Which has led to a range of sad film watching for the both of us. Long story short, I have come close but none have managed to get me. She has challenged herself to try and make me cry from a film. The pursuit of Happiness came close. Five feet apart got me even closer. Also recently watched Bohemian rhapsody which is the first film in a long time to get my eyes moist. Not tear worthy but moist. Context on some films that have gotten to me. Hacksaw ridge. Got to love that storyline and Andrew Garfield was perfectly casted in this one. Million Dollar baby. Watched that as a kid. One if not the best movie I saw as a kid. Near the end I teared up and cried like the baby I was. La vita e Bella. (Life is beautiful) I think if I watched it again I wouldn't cry. It was just one of those right place right time kind of films. I think it was the innocents of the kid that got to me. For more context two books have made me cry. Papillon and the first hungers games. Specifically Rue. Both movie adaptations never really tugged the same heartstrings as the books. I'm putting my money on the internet winning this challenge. I have told her if she manages to do it. I'll give Â£10 (I'm a student or otherwise this would be higher) to whatever charity she wants so it's only fair I give the same challenge to the internet right? Maybe we scratch that idea. Maybe it will never happen. Who knows. My money is on the internet to win this one but she might surprise me. Im letting her choose every second movie we watch so make sure your suggestions are good. I haven't had a good cry at movie in a long time. Need anymore information let me know. Good luck.

I'm putting my money on the internet winning this challenge. I have told her if she manages to do it. I'll give Â£10 (I'm a student or otherwise this would be higher) to whatever charity she wants so it's only fair I give the same challenge to the internet right? Maybe we scratch that idea. Maybe it will never happen. Who knows. 

My money is on the internet to win this one but she might surprise me. Im letting her choose every second movie we watch so make sure your suggestions are good. I haven't had a good cry at movie in a long time. 

Need anymore information let me know. 

Good luck."," Marley and Me, The Pursuit of Happiness, Five Feet Apart, Bohemian Rhapsody, Hacksaw Ridge, Million Dollar Baby, La Vita e Bella, Papillon, The Hunger Games."

So I watched the new Rick and Morty this morning with the Night People and something about the tone struck a chord with me.I liked how in your face it was with the creepiness, the Night People were always just there, and you're just waiting for them to do something fucked up and creepy.I'm looking for other horrors like this. Ones I can think of off the top of my head are Return of The Living Dead 3 and Day of The Dead in terms of having the zombies in the lab with characters interacting with them. I feel like a dick for saying it cause she's a real person, but the weird looking little girl in Hereditary counts, as does the weird swolen kid in Midsommar. Eraserhead I guess counts cause of the weird horse baby thing, not sure, haven't seen it. Child's play franchise. Anyone got any others? No zombie movies please as basically all of them have the zombies present banging at a barrier all the time or something similar.

Hi! So I'm looking for zombie thrillers like World War Z and Train to Busan which do not contain a lot of human-based gore and are relatively modern. I don't mind watching a zombie get burnt or stabbed in the head, but I absolutely can NOT handle any human or animal related gore. The most I can handle is someone getting like shot or stabbed.I'm mostly looking for films that will have me on the edge of my seat the entire film, but will not rely on jumpscares to make me scared (I hate jumpscares). I'm a huge scaredy-cat if you couldn't tell, but I absolutely love zombie films. I just hate how most of them are super gory and horrific.I would also prefer more modern movies, I have a hard time watching anything before the 2000s haha.Thank you!!!

Could be any genre, even romance itself, but without the annoying bs that just seem to get added as fillers.

Thank you :)","

Itâs my favorite movie. Loved it since I saw it on VHS. Do you find a charm in low budget movies? Well, youâll love this one. It looks cheap but itâs got a lot of heart and soul. And it does a good job at showing what our modern world looks like from an outside perspective. Iâd look up a premise since thereâs a word limit for these posts. But basically a Bushmen man in Botswana finds a coke bottle. His village thinks it was a gift from their gods, but it begins to cause a rift. So the main character (named xi) takes it on himself to travel to the edge of the world and throw it off. Itâs like Frodo and the one Ring. There is a greater ensemble of memorable characters that gets woven in to the story as well. But thatâs the basic gist. Give it a go. Itâs great.

I donât watch many classic films, but I really enjoyed this one: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_(1939_film)I appreciated the humor, witty repartee, over the top costumes, and outlandish plot that all tied up neatly at the end. Nothing too life or death or overly dramatic. Not my usual (more of a horror fan), but this was like drinking a cup of chai- a little spicy, warm and comforting. I liked that it was quite fast-paced, as I feel like some classic movies can be paced way too slowly for me. I also really liked John Barrymore, he was great. Iâd appreciate any suggestions!

Hi, everyone. So I'm writing my college dissertation on visual comedy, and there is a section where I want to show a specific kind of humour created using match-cuts (for those who don't know, a match-cut is when you cut from one frame to another where both frames have similar visual qualities, framing, or look-alike objects, like the bone changing to a satellite in *2001*). What I'm looking for is a match-cut example where this change occurs based on a funny comparison of objects. I know plenty of them exist and I've seen a few before, but can't think of one. The closest example I have right now is this funny scene from Breaking Bad:  [I hope it's not only me but I really find this match cut funny : breakingbad (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/lsu58b/i_hope_its_not_only_me_but_i_really_find_this/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Also, I am well aware of a YT video by EveryFramingaPainting about Edgar Wright's visual comedy (can't post the link here). Around the 06:09 mark they give examples of ""funny"" matching transitions. But those are not what I'm looking for. As I have said, I'm looking for match-cuts that compare two-objects in a funny way (Idk, like cutting from a shot of chocolate pudding to a shot of poop because they have a resemblance. Bad example, but you get the idea).Thank you all very much in advance.

Hello, before I get crucified for not watching James Bond, I am only 17 and never got the chance for they weren't shown to me as a child, and as a teen, I wasn't big on action/spy movies.With the disclaimer out of the way, I really do feel kinda disrespectful, or at least uncultured, for not watching James Bond, for I know the movies must be fantastic and they're certainly iconic. I usually like to watch things in the right order, but I'm not sure if the original Bond films are the best to start with as a newbie, and I know that if I start them there, I will be sentencing myself to watch every single one, unless I get bored or burnt out and stop, in which I might skip great movies.Let me know your opinion with all this in mind, thank you all very much for any advice you can give!

I usually like to watch things in the right order, but I'm not sure if the original Bond films are the best to start with as a newbie, and I know that if I start them there, I will be sentencing myself to watch every single one, unless I get bored or burnt out and stop, in which I might skip great movies.

Let me know your opinion with all this in mind, thank you all very much for any advice you can give!", James Bond

This was a very good romantic movie that took a tender memory of mine and flicked it on the ear like a punishment. Made me feel strongly of an emotion I had pushed to the back of my mind.

I'm kind of indecisive when it comes to movies, so I thought I'd ask here so I do not run into the issue of putting something on that my friends and I find boring.Here is my taste of movies I love and some that are beloved by others, but I found quite tedious myself:Films I love (not all horror): Alien, Silence of the Lambs, Body Heat, Mulholland Drive, Rear Window, Inland Empire, The Descent, Rosemary's Baby, The Conversation, Don't Look Now, Halloween, Carrie, Nightmare on Elmstreet, Candyman (1992), etc. etc.I'd like to make a distinction about movies I found boring vs. I liked:We put on 1978's **Dawn of the Dead**, since I have been aware of it being a horror classic. Man, I can't say it was a bad movie, but holy shit, my friends and I were BORED. The next movie we put on was the supposed slasher **Candyman** (1992) which took me by surprise - this is not your typical slasher; it has great storytelling and intelligent pacing you don't see often in these types. Another very similar distinction would be between **Alien** and **Aliens.** 1979's **Alien** is one of my favorite films of all time. **Aliens**, the sequel by James Cameron, was the biggest snoozefest I ever sat through. All it was, was a cheesy action film with no substance (sorry, I get a lot of hate for this, but I prefer the theme of isolation horror and **Aliens** was anything but that).I also detested **Arrival** and **Midsommar** on top of **Dawn of the Dead** and **Aliens** (Dawn of the Dead I can see it's greatness, but personally, I still think Aliens is a piece of crap, sorry).Hopefully, you got an idea of my taste and style of film preferred. Both Aliens and Dawn of the Dead share the similarity of being very action-based, and not having that slow, moving, curious camerawork that works so well with Alien (1979).I appreciate if you read all of this. Below is the list of movies I'm considering:\- Deep Red\- The Devil's Backbone\- The Innocents\- Persona\- Drag Me To Hell\- The Wickerman (1973)\- The Ring (1998)\- Psycho (1960)\- The Endless (2017)

Looking for films of any genre that take place in amazing locations. You almost feel like they could be a real place, a real town, a real village.Doesn't have to be somewhere exotic - just somewhere you think you could lose yourself in.For example:Rescue Dawn (2006) - Intense glorious forest, the sound + visuals were so immersive I almost felt like I was there half-way through the film.The Lost Boys (1987) - If you've seen it you know what I'm talking about, especially the night scenes.East of Eden (1954) - Extremely old but probably the best example of what I'm looking for.

Ok so I'm looking for one of these very niche movie types. I say niche because I haven't really seen many. (This is excluding war movies for the second one.)Ok so the one is, movies where the villain wins. No part two bollocks where the heroes get a second chance and win. I mean one singular stand alone film. The hero tries their best but ultimately they fail, whether that's because the hero gets killed or the hero wasn't good enough. They failed it's over no second chance.The second type I'm looking for is movies where the hero/protagonist dies. Whether they're saving the world or whatever or they've failed. (Kinda ties in with the first.)The third is, movies with a good ai villain. Like WALL-E. That's a good ai villain. No emotionally charged I'm doing this because I want. An ai that's just following it's directive, efficient, unemotional, machine. Ie. ""Computer, fix our planet at any cost.""""Very well, in order to fix the planet I must remove what is destroying it. I MUST eliminate all humans as they're akin to a virus or parasite.""""Oh shit that's not what I wanted you to do at all, now we must destroy you"" It's a crude example but I'm sure it paints a picture right?  I feel like these are ideas that aren't really written or made into moves as they're dark/depressing. So most people probably won't enjoy it like who's going to sit down for an hour just for the villain to win. (Excluding me) and writing an ai villain is hard there's no personal or emotional gain from their directive it's just them doing their job. Or trying to self preserve? I think you get the point.Let me know if you've seen any good movies on these topics âºï¸

Someone reminded me the other day of those [Encyclopedia Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Brown) books I enjoyed as a kid, and I'm curious what mystery movies might be lurking out there with a similar solve-it-yourself feel.  Films like *Knives Out* and *Death On The Nile* are great mysteries I've enjoyed, but you don't get to really play a part.  You just have it all explained to you at the end, including things you couldn't possibly have known or guessed, and there aren't any real clues to decipher along the way.  There was a little taste of what I'm seeking in [*La HabitaciÃ³n De Fermat*](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/5595-la-habitaci-n-de-fermat) (*Fermat's Room*), where characters are presented with puzzles and you actually have a moment or two to guess the answer before they do.  Being able to beat the characters to a solution was fun!  I'm seeking movies where there are discrete clues for eagle-eyed viewers to spot along the way, and which allow you to solve a mystery in logical fashion.  Not particularly looking for films with endless red herrings, as that is just obfuscation and usually done quite lazily.  Thanks for any suggestions!

Being able to beat the characters to a solution was fun!  I'm seeking movies where there are discrete clues for eagle-eyed viewers to spot along the way, and which allow you to solve a mystery in logical fashion.  Not particularly looking for films with endless red herrings, as that is just obfuscation and usually done quite lazily.  


Thanks for any suggestions!"," Knives Out, Death On The Nile, La Habitación De Fermat"

My favorite genre is action horror, or horror action, however you say it. But I'm not about humans fighting back a zombie apocalypse (although that's fun), or soldiers shooting at aliens (also fun). Nah, my favorite stuff is when the mains are not human, and kick serious butt with special abilities, super strength, etc. Vampire action movies come to mind like Blade and Underworld. I like to watch slasher characters fight other slashers, like Freddy vs Jason and Aliens vs Predator. My favorite movie (yes ,not kidding, fav) is Guyver 2: Dark Hero (ignore the first), based on a Manga, where the protagonist is taken over and enhanced by an alien organism, turning him into a rated R Kamen rider/power ranger. I also like immortals like The Crow, The Highlander series. Despite them starting out human, the characters in Mortal Kombat develop special abilities to survive against the inhabitants of Outworld. Now you should have a good idea what I'm looking for, looking forward to suggestions.

Last night (not in Soho lol) I watched that movie and loved it. Iâm a bit of a horror fanatic and I loved those elements, as well as the mystery mixed with social commentary, and most of all the filming style. I grew quite attached to the characters and was on the edge of my seat the whole time, which is rare for me. The elements of sexual abuse got pretty upsetting for me at times, so Iâd rather not watch anything more graphic than that (Iâd watch Promising Young Woman but it might me too much for me to handle emotionally). Iâd prefer something modern but Iâm open to other suggestions. Thank you in advance!

Itâs a dreamy psychological thriller. A woman (Kirsten Dunst) assists her mom in suicide and she grieves her death into hallucinations. Itâs set in Northern California in the redwoods


Itâs very artsy and independent, so you might want to watch it alone and high

Doesnât necessarily have to be animated but something set in that kind of era and part of the world (small town, French/ italian riviera etc). Something relatively light would be good. The movie kind of made me feel nostalgic for a place Iâve never been and an era I wasnât born for. I was kind of imagining my grandparents growing up in a place like that and would like to see if thereâs any movies that can replicate that feeling.

I have done a few obvious ones like Hitchcock before.Edit: Some really awesome suggestions so thanks  everyone! Given me loads to watch and hopefully help the film watchers block that sometimes hits me. Think I am going to pick a director per month and focus on 3/4 of their movies! Looking forward to it.

I have something brewing in my head of an idea of a movie and I was wondering if it existed-Something like 'The Act of Killing', 'Adaptation' or 'F for Fake' where there's multiple facets of reality and the movie deconstructs the multiple layers of reality.But what I was thinking was more of a fusion of 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Hearts of Darkness'Cos the former was a good fiction. And the latter was a good depiction of explaining the process of adapting the original. But I've never seen both qualities done in a movie before.The idea is- the first half of the movie explores a fictional depiction of a conventional movie but then halfway through the camera suddenly stays still and becomes a long take as the characters of the film start walking here and there as they start chit-chatting with each other casually.An estranged and angry relationship of a father and a son established in the first half of the movie as the two actors playing the father and son start talking as though there is no enmity between them.The actors start talking about the catering and how the food tastes decent but not great, and how Stacy just had twins and then after 5 minutes, the director walks up to the camera and says 'Ah fuck- I left it on.'And then the documentary part of the movie begins.And perhaps the movie goes into the lives of each of the actors who play the respective roles as they practice their lines as they go about their day.Does this exist??? I would be so happy if it exists. Someone tell me if this exists.I feel like the closest any show got to what I'm thinking of is in Nathan Fielder's 'The Rehearsal' cos there were some moments where I think it was genuine. But even then, it's not technically a Documentary explaining the process of the production of the creation of a movie but more of breaking down the layers of reality.Which is completely different.

Survival movie where a group or an individual get stranded somewhere far from civilization and have to figure out how to stay alive. I kinda dig the desert vibe so itâd be a plus if the movie is set in the desert. I loved castaway, the tv show lost and an episode of better call Saul titled âbagmanâ.

I just watched King Kong (2006) and now I feel hollow inside. So sad.

Sunshine is a big budget high concept sci-fi that I think is criminally underrated and way ahead of it's time. I see it mentioned now and then on this sub but that's literally it. No one I've asked about it in person since I've seen it has even heard of it. It seems to live in the shadow of movies like Interstellar which is such a shame because I genuinely think it contends with Interstellar in terms of writing, acting, and VFX.The cast has big names like Chris Evans and Cillian Murphy among others. The writing is great, the visual effects have held up extremely well, the plot is nuts and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I have no idea why this movie isn't more popular. The only thing I can think of is the pacing can be a little slow in parts but that doesn't bother me. I had this movie in my watchlist on Amazon for years because it was recommended on this sub and hadn't watched it because I thought it would disappoint me for some reason but it's so worth watching!

I recently watched that new _Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers_ movie, and while most people are comparing it to _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ or _Space Jam_, I've actually noticed some similarities to the first direct-to-DVD Garfield movie.- Multiple art styles: cel-shaded animation, and more detailed CGI (and sometimes uncanny character designs).- Cartoon characters film their own content, but they're not really playing characters, they're just the same as when they're not acting.- The villains are people who want to replace the cartoon with a corporate cash-grab bootleg.- Also, they both have a cool music score and some wholesome/emotional moments.The movie is free on YouTube, uploaded by the official Garfield &amp; Friends channel (blocked in some countries). I can't post the link here, it'll get removed.

For context, I am from India and love watching Hollywood movies. Over the last decade or so, I see a huge amount of left wing influence on Hollywood in almost every movie (pushing leftist ideals of freedom, equality, internationalism, etc.), and mocking right wing principles in the process. The Hollywood game seems heavily rigged towards the Left. Are there any Hollywood movies that are influenced by/promote right wing ideals of nationalism, duty, tradition, etc.? I'm asking this because I strongly believe that in today's age, cinema has the onus as an artistic medium, to subjectively reflect ideals from both the camps, and not skew towards one and mock the other. Hence the query. My sincere request is to not troll me in case I offend anyone here with my question. Apologies for that in advance. Thanks!

I dont care about âbuildupâ.Let me give another example of a movie intense from the start, The Inglorious Basterds.

Basically what the title says. I WFH and want to watch movies while I work, but I need suggestions of movies that are decent, but not great. I have such an extensive list of movies to watch, but I obviously donât want to watch the good ones while Iâm working. What are some good but not great movies that I can give ~50% of my attention to? Any genre is acceptable!

Nikolaj Coster-Waldau stars in this fantastic mystery about a law student working in a morgue who seems to be entangled in a series of murders. This movie made me laugh and feel genuine fear for the characters which is rare in a thriller. The nail biting suspense will keep you at the edge of the seat. They made a remake titled **Nightwatch** with Ewan Mcgregor but I doubt it's as good. The original is definitely my top 10 favorite mystery movies of all time. If you haven't already do yourself a favor and watch it.

Okay, hear me out.Don't know what is that about me, but I've always loved the darkness more than light. It feels right at home, bliss and tranquil, with the light being but an intruder on the eternal darkness of the Universe.The problem is, most people don't see it that way. The reason is, well, evolution, with night being the most dangerous time of the day. Hence associated with dark atmosphere we have terrible beasts (Freddy Kruger), gruesome crimes (Se7en) and the noir despair (Chinatown).**But what about ""good"", kind movies set mostly in the darkness?** Perhaps, foggy, rainy, with a light touch of the moon. But with no need to flinch because of flying limbs or psychological terror (hello Shutter Island).[A visual example of the atmosphere](https://prnt.sc/26opj9q), a pic since youtube isn't allowed.

The experience I'm looking for is rare, alas, but the search is so worth it.UPD #1: ideally I'm looking for something kind and lovely though set in dark atmospheric tones. Like A Man called Uve or The Groundhog day level of uplifting. Maybe a romcom like The Big Sick, anything but thrillers, detectives or the horrors please :DUPD #2: wow, so many responses. Thank you dearly to all who participated! Sadly it seems there are no ""dark but kind"" movies available. ""Over the Garden Wall"" seems to be the closest entry: entirely dark but not negative (an adventure) though rather disturbing (relative to other cartoons). **To any filmmakers who might be reading this - please, expand upon Tim Burton energy and create something profoundly dark, but entirely non negative, with The Groundhog day level of kindness!** I'm off to watching what darkness the modern cinema has to offer, be it with ghosts, vampires or thrillers, eh.

He had tickets to Hero Cup finals and he ditched his friends to meet a random girl for a date he met earlier in the week. Weird enough he was telling his story in his study room which doubled as his library. He was a maths professor, not psychologist. Aunt corroborated the story a few years later.

I'm looking for a movie where the main characters would find some random item, artifact, weapon, or whatever, and they either try to return it to its rightful owners. Or it could be where they do stupid things with it because they don't know how to use it and the owner comes back to get it anyway. It most likely would be a comedy film, but I'm fine with it being an action-adventure film too.

So yeah Im a big fan of mystery movies no matter the format, any sort of movie where there are stakes and an element of unknown such as a conspiracy, a murder, uncovering secrets, finding a missing person, a cold case etc.   Movies similar to what Im looking for are things like Kid Detective, Summer of 84, The Nice Guys, Under the Silver Lake, Searching, The Clovehitch Killer, Brick, Gone Baby Gone, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.   Basically the elements Im looking for are non-police detective characters who are amateur or somewhat amateur, a mystery element that is prominent, and an urban setting (I especially like small towns), bonus points if if the 'detective' character is a woman.  Ive looked at a lot of similar threads already and the answers are usually things Ive seen already or not quite what Im looking for. Id appreciate any recs, thank you.

Three of my favourite movies of the last few years have been Knives Out, Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile.What I like about these movies is the old school style, they're set in an old time, or at least a time that feels old.  Detective is a bit eccentric, but also such a genius, the other characters are fooled  It's a whodunit (This is what I dislike about Columbo, they show who did it from the start, they're ""howdunits"".) I like everyone is a suspect with a motive.  Nice ensamble cast and good acting. Good acting to point of showing off. Kenneth Brannagh carries those Hercule Poirot movies.  Reletevioly new. I've seen the old one, but feel free to recommend them anyway. I might missed a classic.

The best example of that sort of movies are the Indiana Jones movies but I also enjoyed As Above, So Below (2014)I just enjoy it when a person or group are using their historical skills to look for and/or discover old places.  Maybe they know an ancient language or knowledge about an old culture to find a treasure, artifact or maybe closure of some old legend or tale. Other good example is Uncharted (2022), The Adventures of Tintin (2011), and in a sense Pirates of the Caribbean movies, although I would prefer movies that are more down to earth and more focus on the history discovery, rather than full blown adventures.   I am going to watch The Da Vinci Code (2006) and its sequels as they seem to be what I look for, and I guess I have to give the Tomb Raider movies a chance too.   Thanks in advance!

The film, which was trashed by critics upon its release, is basically about Stallone as a bomb specialist, but without giving away the plot, it has some twists that are, frankly, unbelievable.Some of the scenes in it are so ridiculous, though meant to be serious, and I found myself laughing hard during some of these serious scenes (notably, the bus scene if anyone watches it). But in between this ridiculousness, there's some really redeeming qualities that are admirable, like superb cinematography (every shot is done beautifully) that gives it a colorful, uniquely glossed-over vibe that most movies don't have, and probably the best acting job that James Woods has ever done, as a villain.You simply can't watch this film and take it seriously. It's like Showgirls, where it has some scenes so bad that they're good. But I think if this movie is taken as an ""over the top"" surreal crime/mafia thriller or as ""sensory overload"", as one critic put it, it can really be enjoyed for what it is and not what it isn't. It's almost like a comic book brought to life. While most people probably won't like it, I think if it was more known nowadays, it would become a cult classic.

So I have watched  End of Watch (2012) and now recently Sicario (2015) and its sequel from 2018 and I really like the realism and seriousness in them. I find them both pretty unpredictable. I find both of them pretty creepy too, considering you barely see anything from the bad guys perspective, which makes it hard to really know what the police are dealing with.I am looking for more movies similar to these ones. Where you get to follow the police doing the 'practical' job. Arresting, house warrants etc rather than the ones investigating from a desk. Preferably newer movies as I find them less ""hoolywoodesque"" and more unpredictable. TL:DR: I am looking for modern realistic police movies from the police perspective, be it regular troopers or SWAT/DEA etc but not desk job investigative police. Thanks in advance!

My wife and I love to have movie marathons with anime films in particular. We have seen plenty of shows but it is hard for us to commit to something 100+ episodes long, so we like to stick with movies in order to have a complete story arc from start to finish in one sitting due to work and such (open to suggestions for something that is one season long or something short like that as well, but mainly trying to stick with film hence why I am on this subreddit). Of course, we have seen everything from the legends Hayao Miyazaki, Mamoru Hosoda, Makoto Shinkai, and Satoshi Kon (the anime film director Mount Rushmore), but its starting to feel like we are running out of good options outside of the ones that most people know of. Here are some random ones we have really enjoyed but we are open to any kind, no matter what genre, rating, sub/dub, etc:-Redline-A Letter to Momo-Berserk (the Netflix movies)-Gantz:O-Big Fish &amp; Begonia-Mary and the Witch's Flower-A Silent Voice-all of Evangelion-Ghost in the Shell-AkiraI appreciate you for taking the time to help us!

We have seen plenty of shows but it is hard for us to commit to something 100+ episodes long, so we like to stick with movies in order to have a complete story arc from start to finish in one sitting due to work and such (open to suggestions for something that is one season long or something short like that as well, but mainly trying to stick with film hence why I am on this subreddit). Of course, we have seen everything from the legends Hayao Miyazaki, Mamoru Hosoda, Makoto Shinkai, and Satoshi Kon (the anime film director Mount Rushmore), but its starting to feel like we are running out of good options outside of the ones that most people know of. Here are some random ones we have really enjoyed but we are open to any kind, no matter what genre, rating, sub/dub, etc:

-Redline
-A Letter to Momo
-Berserk (the Netflix movies)
-Gantz:O
-Big Fish &amp; Begonia
-Mary and the Witch's Flower
-A Silent Voice
-all of Evangelion
-Ghost in the Shell
-Akira

I appreciate you for taking the time to help us!","

I think this is an unfairly underrated Ray Liotta movie out there. The story in brief is about a happily married couple(starring Kurt Russell and Madeleine Stowe) trying to settle down in a not-so-safe neighbourhood. One night a robber breaks into their house, but couldn't do any harm to them other than throwing the wife into the swimming pool. They had to call Officer Pete Davis(starring Ray Liotta). As Pete was initially nice and helpful to them, they tried to befriend him. But, little did they know who Pete actually was beneath that facade of a nice guy.I strongly recommend this movie especially to thriller-lovers like me.

This movie is a story about relationships, camaraderie, family, marriage, social class, a fair amount of drugs, a lot of booze, and a ton of sex. It's also an amazing snapshot of Mexico as it heads into the 21st century.Julio and Tenoch are close friends who spend a lot of time together and get up to a lot of mischief.  It is a story about one weekend in their lives.  I don't want to go further into detail because that would ruin it.Amazing camera work, a fun soundtrack, a lot of symbolism, and a narrator to help viewers keep track of things and  provide insights.I knew 2 things going in: that there was sex involved and that everyone I know who's seen this film has said good things about it. I thought it was amazing.  Check it out.

I just watched High-Rise for the first time last night and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved the cinematography and direction of the film, the crisp shots, nice suits and costume design, the dystopian future, the surrealism and general vibe that it gave off was extraordinarily entertaining. The fact that it had many sex scenes and yet that wasn't the focus of the film per se (not that I would have an issue with that, I just found that the way they represented it worked well). I was hoping to receive some recommendations for films similar to this one in its presentation and vibe. I enjoy dystopian futures where society looks nice on the outside but things are very wrong, the vibe of the society in Gattaca is a good example, feels kind of empty often times, sleek and clean, etc... It doesn't have to be a dystopian future however if you feel that there is a movie that fits what I am describing then please by all means suggest it. I hope I have done a decent job describing what I am looking for however it is difficult since I enjoyed the overall feel of the movie and perception changes person to person. Thanks in advance for your suggestions and I hope you have a great day.

It also started (or fueled) a lot of riots and protests against racism. I'm asking for films like this which was deeply impactful, doesn't necessarily have to be like ""La Haine"". Thanks.

I adore this genre of film but I'm not super familiar with any outside of massively popular stuff like old Disney films lol. My favourite films and examples of what I mean by this are things such as Chirin no Suzu (1978), Fantastic Adventures of Unico (1981), Oliver &amp; Company (1988), Chuchelo-Myauchelo (1982), etc. I find films from this era always have such beautiful artwork and characteristics I love that are not easily found in many modern childrens' films. If you know any good vintage kids films let me know and I'll give them a watch when I can!I know the title also says 2D, but if you reeeally want you can comment with films made in other mediums, too. The only example of other mediums I can think of is the short film Losharik (1971).(A couple of films that fit this description I've already been meaning to watch are Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland (1989), The Seventh Brother (1991) and The Last Unicorn (1982). If you've seen any of these already I'd love to hear what you thought about them!).

On a bit of a thriller / suspense kick so looking for something about stalking. Think the opening twenty minutes of the original When a Stranger Calls but dragged out over a whole movie. Doesnât have to be stalking necessarily, just some solid slow burn thriller.

I need to see movies that are just pleasing to the eyes. Stunningly beautiful visuals.From use of vibrant colors, natural scenery and low lighting to artistic backgrounds, anything. Anything that would make me awe ONLY from how it looks. It doesn't have to be Trippy or trance like visuals, but I would consider them too. Also, it would be great if the film was made after 2000 so I could have it in 16:9 and atleast 1080p (4k would be ideal though). The movie itself could be anything really, I don't care for the ratings and critics.Here are some movies that I think were like this (Spoilers):1. Last Night In Soho (2021) for the Vibrant Colors and dreamy visuals2. The Ritual (2017) for the beautiful scenery of Scandinavian forests, the movie itself was good too with a Lovecraft like plot. 3. Coraline (2009) Seriously this one checks out everything I am asking for. It is the most visually stunning movie I can think of4. Wolfwalkers (2020) Another animated movie that feels like a dream, because of the visuals. Good use of colors. Your recommendations could be entirely different from these films since I am not looking for a specific plot. So feel free to suggest anything. Thanks

Complicated marriage. Their damage/awfulness usually being revealed to be influenced by something in the past.

With Christmas just around the corner, and after a way-too-early barrage of requests for Christmas movies, it is finally time for me to post this suggestion. The Swedish black comedy, titled *Tomten Ã¤r far till alla barnen* in its origin language, revolves around a woman who invites her three ex-husbands to celebrate Christmas with her and her new husband. As you might expect, the evening derails into explosive in-fighting, which is only further aggravated by an announcement the wife makes. The movie is full of twists and turns, which I do not want to spoil, but it is definitely worth a watch if you want a break from corny Hallmark Christmas movies.

It really is amazing how [these films](https://zinbin.com/bin/1711) continue to get better and better. Obviously the stunts help create tension and theyâre well executed.

It's a south Indian movie.. It takes place in a mysterious lil' village called ""CHURULI""...The mannerisms and the way of talking is filled with vulgarity and swearing which surprises the two cops that come in in search of a criminal called ""Joy"".... At first, the movie seems like a normal rural movie , but believe me! After reaching the climax, you will be left clueless! It had been a controversial addition to Indian cinema because of the insane magnitude of swearing, but I think for foreigners, the subtitles would neutralize it all, which is kinda sad. I'd recommend watching an explanation video after it to make you understand the brain-twister element.. I give it an 8/10, Highly Recommended !

I'm not sure if title really makes it clear what i mean. Lately i'm having a hard time watching full-on comedies, especially newer ones from USA. I want to have a laugh but i'm not in the right mind-space for cartoony buffonata. I'm thinking about something like Californication or Big Lebowski, it's funny and sometimes immature but still in a very human way. Semirealistic without being outright depressing or daunting. I don't even really care about the genre, for example a couple of days ago i watched ""Collateral"". It's not a funny movie but it was engaging and also funny from time to time, at least until the final 3rd of the movie. First ""Clerks"" also do kinda fit what i want, although it's a bit too indie and too cartoony in some parts of course. Hopefully my description makes at least some sense.

This might be a difficult one due to how vastly unique and grand this film is. Ever since I first watched it I absolutely fell in love with it, an instant favorite of mine. I am looking for more non-traditional (more arthousey, less Star Warsy) older sci-fi epics that deal with heavy philosophical and existential concepts. I know OTSG is an extremely unique film just looking for something with a similar atmosphere and/or themes. The closest film to it iâve seen is *Hard to be a God (2013)* although extremely different films they give off a similar atmospheric feeling of being present in the filmâs deeply chaotic world. Any recommendations are much appreciated!

This trilogy of short films is easily one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever. If you haven't seen it, this is a suggestion post. If you have, it's a requesting post.Seriously. What else; whether movie, short film, tv series, tv episode, or YouTube video, accomplishes anything like World of Tomorrow? The closest thing I can think of is Midnight Gospel.

Those movies are good but the main character is so utterly isolated, I have a hard time relating to them, not to mention that Travis in Taxi Driver is clearly mentally ill.

I really want to watch something that is slow and poetic that would tingle my spirit, is not too overwhelming and not too cringy either.

Just watched this and thought it would be worth recommending as I havenât seen it pop up much on this sub. I think itâs marketed as horror but itâs really a psychological character piece.Without getting too into it, itâs a story of a guy whoâs become circumstantially lonely and turns to dating/friendship video tapes (set in early 90s) to comfort himself.Recommending because it was an interesting hook and it makes you feel empathy for the main character without going too far and making him completely hopeless.

I always assumed that this was one of those Oscar Winners for Best Picture that looked boring and staid. A safe pick by the voters over its more inventive contemporaries (for reference, the movie Alfie was nominated the same year). I couldnât have been more surprised by what I experienced. While it is based off of a stage play, it has some gorgeous cinematography and some inventive shots. The performances are beyond superb. Paul Scofield is hugely charismatic and steals every scene he is in with deft expressions and witty repartee. He deserved his best actor win. Robert Shawâs King Henry is regal and menacing. You really do get a sense of why he makes the decisions he does from his reactions. All in all, I heartily recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching great acting and dynamic stage adaptations.

I'm wondering what other novels are out there that were adapted to great movies?

Prefer thriller, crime, true crime, suspense, drama thriller, etc.

Needs to be an easy read (I have limited free time unfortunately).

I was thinking about checking out The Warriors and The Godfather next.

(Because  these are two of my favorite movies).

Other suggestions would be great! 

What has everyone read and enjoyed that later became a movie?

Thanks!!","
No Country for Old Men, The Warriors, The Godfather"

A film wherein people attack someone be it a lone drifter or a couple or a family but generally someone being attacked and it turns out that the person that they attacked is significantly worse than they are like in No One Lives  the robbers/gang attack the driver only to find out he's a nearly inhuman torturing kidnapping psychopath. Bloody Hell is similar but with more of an ""this is our protagonist he does not seem like such a bad guy.""  A bit unhinged and willing to kill but not like some walking mass murdering torture machine but still capable of killing people. Personally if I could find more like No One Lives I very happily would but am also happy with a psychopathic hallucination conscience type of movie.

I really would like to watch it because Iâve heard great things about it and I enjoy Christopher Nolanâs work. However, I also find his films to be really layered and confounding. Iâm wondering if Iâll be able to follow along with the plot well enough to understand whatâs going on? What are your opinions about the film? Love it, like it or hate it?

I watched Tales of Hoffman after reading it was Martin Scorcese's favorite movie, and I'm fascinated by the style. A scene which I've thought a lot about occurs at 1:28 in the trailer which shows two characters dancing down a staircase, which is painted on the floor. After watching this movie, I found Dogville. Do you have a suggestion for other films such as these? Also, is expressionist the right term to describe how the director creates the world without relying on realistic set design?

Hi! Iâm looking for some good espionage movies, especially those set in Nazi Germany or the USSR (or at least, related to the Cold War/WWII). Some of the things Iâm looking for include:-Very subtle, realistic tone â nothing like James Bond or extremely stylised. -Historical accuracy isnât hugely important, in the sense that it doesnât have to be a literal portrayal of real historical events (tho itâs cool if it is). However, it should not be directly or obviously contradictory to history, and should feel like âthis definitely could have happenedâ even if it didnât. -The film should be very dense and complicated, with lots of moving parts that are hard to keep track of-If set in a non-English speaking country, the film should be in that language and not just English -The atmosphere should be generally paranoid, and ideally with a lot of âgreyâ morality/moral ambiguity-I really hope this goes without saying, but no nazi propagandaAny recommendations would be much appreciated, thank you!

I might make it more difficult to suggest something, but let me be clear about what I'm requesting. Movies like Joker, Nightcrawler, Taxi Driver, and Leon the Professional are great. But at best, the main characters are a sort of chaotic neutral. And I have no problem watching a movie like that, but it's not quite what I'm looking for. I want a main character who is very awkward, but could be considered morally good throughout. Slingblade gets it close, but the main character has an obvious mental handicap that would explain his awkwardness. Edward Scissorhands is almost perfect. I think the only problem with that is its hard to consider Edward's lack of social skills a fault, considering he's basically being thrown into a world he's not familiar with. It's so close, though. So yeah. Main character is both notably socially unskilled, but also does his/her best to be a good person. That's what I'm looking for.

It honestly feels like it could have been made a year after ""Do America"" in terms of the writing, other than superior animation techniques, and for someone who was a fan of the original run, it has some genuine belly laughs all the way through. 

EXACTLY what you would and should expect from a Beavis and Butthead film. Very funny and completely infantile in all the best possible ways.

Perhaps this question is better aimed at people who know theatre, but here goes. I know there are a LOT of movies that are direct play to screen, so not those movies.. What movies creatively take a storyline FROM a Shakespeare play and repackage it? They don't even have to be 'modernized', just creatively moved from the original. Example is Lion King (Hamlet) and a handful of romantic comedies... Again it doesnt have to be a WHOLE play translated, but key plot points borrowed from Shakespeare... Please share what you know. Thank you!

As the title says, I'm the looking for movies with entertainment values. The genre doesn't matter as long as it isn't a slow burner.I'm not looking for movies with too much Drama (Gladiator, Green Book) or weird concepts (Donnie Darko). Also, not looking for thriller with slow plot development like Psycho (I love the movie just not in the mood right now).Movies with sports theme(or something the protagonist is struggling with) is one of the genres I'm interested in. Examples of such are Whiplash, The Fighter, Rocky.Would also love to watch Good comedy/rom-com/wholesome movies like Superbad, Zombieland, The Truman Show, P.S I love you, La La Land, Good will hunting.Action movies with good entertainment like Die Hard, Edge of tomorrow will also do.

I wanted to feel nostalgic and was trying to think back to the movies my teachers would play like on the last few days of school, rainy days and when they didn't want to teach (now I realize they probably had hangovers sometimes)For me it was the Sandlot (I'm convinced they issued a VHS of this movie to every 90s classroom), Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Goofy Movie and RocketMan from 1997 with Harland Williams (which I watched recently and it's freaking hilarious!) I was wondering what movies everyone else grew up watching in school?

I really enjoy the overprotective families/friends, like in Bad Boys when the daughter is going on a date for the first time and Mike and Marcus try scaring him offOr Sydney White, tomboy because she grew up with male figures but isn't actively trying to be a tomboy. Cheaper by the Dozen is technically also included in this, tho not only brothers/male relatives but still overprotectiveI would say Flipped too, since she is a bit of a tomboy without trying to be, she didn't grow up with only brothers. I like tomboys who don't base their entire personalities on being tomboysNot the most 'award-winning' movies, but I enjoy them. I'm open for tv movies that are generally quite bad, I've watched my fair share of cringe movies on youtube but I still enjoy them

I've seen a lot of Korean films like Parasite, The Wailing, The Handmaiden, etc but saw only a few Japanese movies. It seems like most of the well known ones are anime but I'm more interested in what Japan puts out with regards to live action. I've looked through /r/JapaneseMovies but thought to ask here as well.Some Japanese films I really enjoyed:- The World of Kanako: thriller based on a schoolgirl named Kanako- We Made A Beautiful Bouquet: about a boy and girl who start a relationship in college and how it progresses over time- Battle Royale: Hunger Games was based off or inspired by this, basically the same concept

A film about an elite group of wildfire firefighters. Fantastic movie! I didnât know the true sorry and I just urge you to watch it not knowing. Directed by the director of Top Gun Maverick, Oblivion, and Tron Legacy. The cover art looked like generic nonsense with a couple actors I liked but not a Miles Teller fan (heâs really good though). Turns out Taylor Kitsch with a mustache and the always reliable James Badge Dale in supporting roles. Jennifer Connelly is absolutely fantastic in this. Just an awesome movie about real people. Iâm sad I overlooked it for so long but happy to finally watch it. Thatâs all Iâll say about it. Again if you donât know the story itâs based on just watch and see what you think.

Started my October off right with this incredible Korean film, and as Iâve been seeing a lot of October movie requests, I figured this should go in as a overarching suggestion.  Fair warning: Iâm pretty sure this is top tier scary and unnerving, comparable to The Witch and Hereditary, but I know many have a spectrum of how horror affects them.I love the way this movie brings you in casually, and then ensnares you completely.  Itâs a masterclass of pacing, suspense, atmosphere, character, the lead actor is PHENOMENAL in his breadth, and the film also has some great commentary that caught me off guard as quite hilarious.  It feels very genuine to how a normal person may experience such things.Check it out if youâre looking for that scary stuff in October! And Iâd love to discuss in the comments, so be wary of spoilers past this point.

So I love this movie specifically the determination of the main character and want more of that ""I will be great"" sort of style I'd love to see something like this but with writing. If that is not possible I am fine with literally anything else that fits that mold but my intial intention was to find the writing equivalent of whiplash.

Iâm a sucker for liminal spaces, and recently, I just finished In the Tall Grass, and though overall I didnât enjoy the movie (mentions of incest and baby eating just arenât my cup of tea) I was so interested in the concept of a constantly shifting, identical maze. Thatâs one of my biggest fears. Iâd love to see more movies where the setting is a liminal space, or a back rooms type of environment. Horror is preferred, but it doesnât even have to be horror!

By old i mean pre 80s. I'm looking for movies that you consider so advanced for their time that it feels like a modern movie sometimes, either in style, narrative or technical aspects. Bonus points if it's a hidden gem.For example, i recently watched ""Teorem"" (1968), and i was so impressed with the movies' direction, style, pacing of the shots and usage of soundtrack, that sometimes it felt like i was watching a recent arthouse film. What other movies do you suggest?Edit: after reading some suggestions, i think i need to express myself better. I'm more interested in movies that are advanced because of aspects related to the direction, artistic aspects (such as pacing of the shots, framework, usage of soundtrack, etc), rather than the thematic or special effects.

Hi.I am non-english speaker person, and recently I decided to rewatch one of my favourite movies: Whiplash. This time I rewatched it with Latin American spanish dub. While watching it,  I noticed something, I felt like the movie loses its magic, because one of the things that makes Whiplash truly great is the J.K. Simmons performance which makes Fletcher a truly terryfing villain,  something that's missing when you're watching the dubbed version. So my question is, What are some movies you should never see dubbed? I've readed somewhere The Father (2021) is one of those.

I really can't stand romantic movies (drama or comedy) where the main character is usually meeting the other protagonist and they have a partner already. And we're supposed to root for this person? And in the end it's usually ok because we find out their partner is somehow less than perfect (usually a minor personality issue but they're actually a good person realistically), which makes it all ok. E.g. you've got mail, something borrowed, serendipity.  But my partner and I would like to try and watch more romance movies, and I'd like to be able to enjoy it too!(ETA: don't mind the plot line when the person is actually properly held responsible. E.g ""the other woman"" is a pretty funny enjoyable movie that happens to have cheating).

The two obvious examples that come to mind are ""The Fifth Element"" and ""Bladerunner"". Another albeit obscure but very accurate setting to describe what I'm looking for would be the black market in Pacific Rim when they go visit Hannibal Chau, played by Ron Perlman.Lastly, here's a couple sci-fi fantasy images that better show what I mean: [https://imgur.com/a/w3ecXQN](https://imgur.com/a/w3ecXQN)

   This is maybe an atypical request, but I am looking for a film suggestion with willful blindness as a theme, or a character who refuses to see/recognize something that is right in front of their eyes, no matter how painfully obvious it becomes. Alternatively, a movie with a plot hole to that effect, i.e. any actual person would have noticed something that the characters do not. I ask because I am taking a Trial class in law school, and we have an assignment to do a mock closing argument. I am exploring a theme around the defendant's alibi being fanciful, and want to draw parallels to fictional stories, but I am drawing a blank.  I apologize if this is not the appropriate sub for this kind of thing, but thought it was worth a shot.EDIT: Alright, I' am off to go give my closing statement. Thank y'all for all the suggestions. I can't believe I didn't think of Don't Look Up /u/slicineyeballs, which I will be referencing (and have been meaning to watch). Also huge thank you to /u/Sure_Whatever__ for the Good Will Hunting quote. I took that and ran with it and am basing my theme around it. So if I get an A, I owe you one!

Earlier this year, I saw Doctor Strange 2 and thought it was decent. Then I saw Everything, Everywhere, All At Once take the âmultiverseâ and âparental loveâ tropes that Strange 2 had and run with it in such a more effective way than Strange 2 did that it actually made Strange 2 worse. Shortly afterward, I saw Alex Garlandâs Men, and hated it. Then the next day I decided to catch The Northman before it left theaters, which is also a dark film that critiques toxic masculinity in such a vastly superior way that it made Men 100x worse. What other movies may not have gotten a fair shake because they were thematically outperformed in the theater?

If you're unfamiliar, Ursula (voiced by Janeane Garofalo in the Disney distro) is just a lady in a cottage in the woods living her life. She doesn't have a prominent love interest, she doesn't have a central conflict, she just lives in her little shack and occasionally comes into town to sell her artwork or buy supplies or whatever. She's meant to fill something of a big sister crush role, I think. We've tried looking up movies about independent women but so many of those lists are populated by descriptions like ""After her sexual assault..."" or ""Raised to be a killing machine..."". Pretty sure I've personally trawled through multiple top 100 lists without a single title that would pass the Bechdel Test let alone... Anyway, it's been frustrating.She's in the other room right now watching a movie called ""Forest Bathing"" which, near as I can tell, is just an hour of exploring a forest. I'm not even sure there's characters. That's the kind of stuff she's into; slow TV, goblincore (sort of cottagecore but if the cottage were mostly reclaimed by nature), a lot of Ghibli-style stillness, and now she wants to watch some stuff where a woman can just be on her own in nature without having to fight off rapists or werewolves or the men who would reclaim her for their super soldier program or whatever. Don't get me wrong, she's not averse to said nature lady having relationships or conflict or what have you, it's more the specifically superfluous pathos that we're trying to avoid. The only content I think we're trying to avoid outright is animals in peril (within reason. sometimes you gotta kill and eat stuff etc no need for suffering though), onscreen sexual assault is right out, and horror in general will probably not be watched by her, at least not right away (although it will probably be watched by me tbh, love me some quietly dreading the woods).I hope this isn't too niche or, worse, too poorly articulated. Thanks in advance for trying:)

I'm looking for a very specific genre of movies, and would like some tips on what to seek out. Think ""Under Fire"" from 1983, or Oliver Stone's great underrated classic ""Salvador"". These are films where our protagonist(s) are caught in a foreign country during some sort of polictical conflict, and more often than not they feel like road movies, passing through locations on a drama-thriller journey. They might be journalists, reporters, detectives or just civilians in an unfortunate situation, but for the time being they are there and they have to deal with it.I'm aware sub-genres like this may come across as slightly problematic, since most of these movies are about white people being pressent (and often heroes) in a story that isn't really theirs to tell, basically just shoehorned in for American audiences to wanna watch. Yet, I just really, really enjoy these kinds of stories; the way they make me feel, and can't get enough of them. It's also not important for the movie to be in English or to have a western lead (2017s ""First They Killed My Father"" comes to mind), the ones I've seen just tend to be made in Hollywood. Other movies that fall under this category for me are ""The Year of Living Dangerously"", ""The Killing Fields"", ""The Last King of Scotland"", Steven Spielberg's fantastic ""Empire of the Sun"" and ""Beyond Rangoon"" by John Boorman, which is a mixed bag. Some war movies also cross into this genre, like ""Apocolypse Now"", it's spiritual counterpart ""Farewell to the King"".This might be long, confusing request, but can anyone think of movies like this for me to seek out? I would really love some suggestions. I've already searched long and hard, but might be missing a lot since I don't have a name for what I'm looking for.

Is cinema on the decline? Myself and my 2 friends are cinephiles in our late thirties and early forties. We are academically trained in film analysis, are experienced film reviewers, and have easily viewed tens of thousands of movies from every era, genre, and film producing local in history. Problem is, with professions in other fields and as parents of younger children (3-10), weâve lost touch. We met up for the first time in a while and weâre all bemoaning just how few movies we get to watch (a couple a month, instead of at least one a day), the types of movies we get to watch (our kids Disney+ stuff and a few contemporary mainstream releases), and, most importantly, the state of modern cinema (whoâs pushing the medium?). Weâve kept up with whatâs going on, but thereâs just little that makes us excited enough want to chase down new releases. The point was made that weâre probably just some out of touch old farts and that thereâs a bunch of cinephiles out there in there teens and twenties that can expose us to what going on now. So, younger cinephiles, are we correct that television, serialized web based content, and video games have / are about to take over cinema as the leading audio visual, temporal art form? Have all the true innovators gone elsewhere? If not, what are the non-franchise, self contained films from the last decade that justify film as retaining the title of the greatest art form of them all?

Me and my mother cannot agree on a film to watch if our lives depended on it. I generally am really fond of more epic films (Gladiator, Last Samurai, 300, Troy, Braveheart, Kingdom of Heaven, Master and Commander etc) and historical films or films inspired by classics (The Kingâs Speech, The Man In The Iron Mask, Victoria, Little Women, etc). She is too, but recently she hasnât been in the mood for it. Sheâs into âsocial and psychological dramasâ (The Lost Daughter, Marriage Story, Passing, Call Me By Your Name) etc. I cannot stand these. She loves horror films but Iâm scared to death by even a hint of horror. I like films about mafia and WWI and WWII, but itâs not very much her speed. Neither of us is into most romances, dog films or comedies. I *love* films from the 90s and early 2000s, but sheâs the kind of person who likes to see recently released stuff. Films we can agree on recently have included heist films (like Oceans 11), the best 007 films, good films with a plot more centred around external conflicts instead of internal (think Apollo 13), etc. In summary, things that arenât (necessarily) super silly,but that are still pretty straightforward and generally enjoyable for most audiences. Anyone has any ideas for this very complicated puzzle?

ever just need a good old sad film? Well, not necessarily sad in itself, but one that makes you sad/cry? Iâve found myself watching a lot of comedies and feel-good films lately, and I just want to have that deep film feeling again, also, in need of a cry, itâs been a while. Leave some suggestions, nothing too mainstream though because Iâve probably seen it. The film doesnât have to be categorically good, just emotional really. Thanks in advance!!!

I put it off for years because I'd read the synopsis of it saying stuff about ""When an FBI agent is sent on a mission after the cartel, blah blah blah"" it honestly sounded boring to me, but totally get why everyone was so hyped about it now. It's so much more than any synopsis would have you think (as are most movies tbf) This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the WHOLE way through. I was never bored, not through one scene. Also, the plot is just complex enough to keep you thinking and wondering what's going to happen next without being overly-complicated like so many movies feel the need to be. Well acted, well written, well directed, it should certainly be on your list!For reference of my taste here are some of my all time favs:Ex MachinaDuneArrival V For VendettaThe Godfather

If anyone wants a good zombie horror movie for Halloween that may have flown under your radar, there's a 2021 French Canadian movie called Brain Freeze. It takes place in a wealthy island community of Montreal. These are the same rich who are arrogant and hypocritical in what they support politically vs. what they actually do in real life. The community residents use an experimental artificial substance to melt snow in the winter so the rich can play golf year-round. Little do they know that this substance seeps into the community tap water, turning anyone who drinks it, from humans to pets, into grass-growing zombies that bite other innocent victims, turning them into zombies as well. Eventually, these zombies downright disintegrate into grass. Andre, the son of one of the rich community members, must defend his baby sister Annie from this horrible fate, and must work with a community employee in order to find a way to undo the disease causing this zombification.

Before Sunrise.I watched it for the the first time this evening after seeing stills/quotes from the film pop up in my Instagram feed for several years. It has something ridiculous like 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. There are so many people on Instagram who are glorifying this movie as though it is some artistic, deep masterpiece. In my opinion, it was like watching a movie written by a teenager. It was also incredibly boring - the entire film was merely the two chracters talking general chit chat with each other.

I know Iâm going to regret it but I want movies that will scare me . The pale male in pans labyrinth ,or the scene with the doppelgÃ¤nger in annihilation are the best examples I have . Not only the monster,but also the settings (music and score ,surrroundings ,  timing ,context) For those two movies ,I had to look around me while watching them ,and look behind me .I  couldnât sleep and had to lock myself in the bedroom ,look under the bed in case there may be something under , take twice as many sleeping pills .but I love it TLDR; pls recommend me some scary movies like pale man in pans labyrinth or doppelgÃ¤nger in annihilation with haunting score and settingsEdit: the voice is something I care about in movies (no matter the genre), so a scary voice might do the trick . The bunny in Donnie darko for example scared me

What I'm looking for is a movie where the villain isn't exactly obvious and pretends to be stupid or weaker than they actually are. Now I love movies with big twists so I'd like it if it had a big twist too. Also I'd prefer if the person who turns out to be the villain is a woman because I just like badass bosses but it doesn't have to be. You're also allowed to spoil the movie because honestly I think knowing the twists doesn't really change how I view the movie.p.s: I don't really want to watch anything too old like 40 years old is the maximum.Edit: kind of like Primal fear or the usual suspects

Hello friends,Heavy lurker of this forum and use the search function multiple times daily to reap the benefits of the wonderful recommenders of this subreddit, thank you all for that!For a long time I've tried to figure out what it is that I like about a movie and I think that I have narrowed it down to a few core things that I can think is what gets me hooked:* The most important thing I think is that there is/are strong lead character(s) that is/are troubled/self-destructive in some way and also display superior intelligence/emotional intelligence to peers. It doesn't have to be that the person is a genius, just the feeling of there being more to that character than their surroundings and that it troubles the character in some way (I think what I mean here is an underlying feeling of not really fitting in)* The troubled/self-destructive character(s) goes through some kind of metamorphosis or experiences change/going through something. I cannot really pinpoint exactly what I mean by this because this can be building a business (e.g., There will be blood) or trying to get/fit into a new social environment (e.g., Mid90s). Could be short term (e.g., Superbad, Ex Machina) or long term (e.g., Wolf of Wallstreet, The Social Network)* I tend to prefer 'newer' films (i.e., 2000+) as I feel like poor visuals can sometimes get in the way (The Thing was ruined for me the second I saw the monster :( ). Of course I won't swear by this and any recommendation is appreciated, but please do have this in mind. So for thrillers/horror I try to prefer an invisible threat over monstersI understand that the above list might not make sense what so every as I didn't specify any genre, basically it seems like I need a self-destructive/anxious but smart character that doesn't really fit in. Here are some examples that I can think of on top of my head that are movies that I LOVED:* There Will Be Blood* Mid90s (idk why but I think this movie is a masterpiece)* Wolf of Wallstreet* The Sound of Metal* Nightcrawler* Whiplash* The Social Network* EX Machina* Tenet* The VVitch* Wheelman* Superbad* Hereditary* CODA* It comes at night* Uncut gems* Upgrade* The Big Short* Memento* The Disaster Artist* True Detective season 1 (not a movie but the lead is a spot on example at least for everything that isn't comedy)Of course there are many more, but I just tried to include some of my all-time favourites where half of them I cannot explain why they are an all-time favourite haha. Have watched all A24 films (feel like I needed to say that lol). Also, if you see a pattern between the movies that I wrote as examples that I may not have thought about, please do let me know.

It accurately depicts what the troops went through during World War I. We study about it in school, but this video truly brought it to life. It also demonstrated how millions of lives were sacrificed in vain.I really liked 1917 when it initially came out, and my personal favorite is the Tuskegee airmen; I didn't care for the Red Tails version.I'm now watching The Forgotten Battle on Netflix. I'm hoping it's excellent. It is set during World War II.So, tell me, what are some of your favorite war movies? I intend to binge watch a lot of them.

Not particularly looking for an emotional movie or one about the war on the field. Maybe more about the politics. I need something that captures that depression and the sense of helplessnes you always get when you read about that stuff (I like those color filters they use to dim everything) Spy movies are fine too.

I would like to see a movie with low budget and high concepts, I mean concepts that take over the whole movie, some examples of these movies are : Primer, Coherence or The Man From Earth. I don't want to spoil them for who hasn't watched them but I'll do it with obscured text right here (spoilers ahead)&gt;!for example in Primer two engineers and physicists learn how to time travel in quite a complicated but cool manner and decide to intelligently make money with it. In Coherence a group of people gets Schroedinger-ed and end up basically fighting themselves and in the Man from Earth there's this man that's immortal and has lived for over 14.000 years talking to collegues that are college professors and sharing his life story as a guise of a thought experiment.!&lt;All these movies don't have a big budget but they grap you and never let go until they finish and I absolutely loved them and would like to know if there's more movies like these out there because I would definitely love to watch them. I'm not a very intelligent person but I'm absolutely compelled by these let's say ""intelligent"" movies which do something amazing that even big budget movies often cannot. Other movies like those are Synchronicity and Time Crimes in case you needed other examples. ThanksEdit: even if it's not low budget if it still has compelling concepts and arguments it's fine too, ex:interstellar, I think it tackles relativity very well in a way that even a 4yo can understand it and I loved it for it!

Im looking for those movies or shows about people that do bad things but then it comes back to them in an almost humorous way. The universe always returns suffering back to sender kind of movies? even though life went as planned, the universe steps in and ruins the plan. So if someone seems to be successful its all just a ploy the universe is using so that they can be humbled in the end. For example one person brags to their friends about expensive objects and then later on he mets his dream woman but she treats him exactly like an object. This makes fun of the way that he bragged about owning an object but now he is metaphorically the object that he was bragging about having.

Watching anything made before the 1980s is always a bit of a challenge for me. I've only seen around 200 movies from 1979 and before, which might sound like a lot but compared to how many modern films I've seen it's really not much.I know that if I'm going to get more into classic cinema I'm going to have grow a taste or at least get used to the older styles, but for now are there any older films that could bridge that gap? For reference, pre-80s films I've loved include Taxi Driver, Carnival of Souls, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, In the Heat of the Night, Psycho, Sunset Blvd. and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

Edit: I will look into all of the movies suggested. Thanks for the recommendations.", Carrie

Hi,My request may sound strange but if you've seen the moves / series I'll give as example, you probably see what I mean.I'm searching for thriller movies where there is a sense of fear of an all-powerful organisation (enterprise, state, group...). I am looking for that because I just went through my 2nd rewatch of the serie Homecoming from Sam Esmail and it's one of my all-time favorites. This sense is made by making you feel that the characters are always controlled yet they think they are free. There is a lot of hints showing you what happens behind the curtains but you are never sure wether they are critical or not. Here it's the Geist enterprise manipulating everyone and always have a head start on our characters. **This makes me feel crushed by the sense that something bigger but invisible is manipulating the characters. I love that feeling and I'm looking to feel it again.** It can be compared as a conspiracy theory, except here it is perfectly plausible because it's made by real instances of power. What I absolutely love is when characters tries to fight back or investigate more but are stopped with ease by the opacity of bureaucracy. It makes the situation feel helpless.There is a lot of variants of this feeling, but my favorite ways of doing it are with Sam Esmail, so Homecoming and Mr Robot. On the movie side, I can't think of any movies right now even if I'm sure I've already seen some with that feeling. I could say that the feeling is similar to The Matrix or Dark City with this idea of something behind the curtain, but I'm looking for a more realistic approach. The bureaucracy approach is similar to what is done in Brazil, but even if this movie is one of my all time favorite I'm seeking for something in a world similar to ours.I'm sorry if this request is strange and difficult to understand, I tried to describe it as much as I could, given that english is not my mother language.I would be happy to hear any recommendation.Have a great day !

This is a seemingly broad request but the feeling Iâm looking for is very specific. Movies that are edited and scored in such a way that just slaps. The sound and camera movements and editing work together in a way that generates emotions or simply kick ass.

You know? I canât describe what connects these movies, but the way theyâre scored and cut and paced just slaps. Give me a list of movies that slap.

Looking for a good fantasy film that shows fantastical creatures, fae, or just a general fairy tale aesthetic.  Iâve loved this movie since I was a kid and itâs really nostalgic for me, so Iâd like to branch out more and find similar things.  Think of r/fairytaleasfuck vibes.  I donât mind watching movies meant for children, but preferably not something like The Never Ending Story.  I donât know why but I have trouble getting into a lot of fantasy films made during that time period.  Itâs also fine to recommend films from any culture - I really enjoy things like Totoro too with the little soot sprites and so forth.

Primarily ones about feeling lonely at a younger age (18-25)? These have always (oddly) been good therapy for me lmao. Keep in mind that 'loneliness' in this sense isn't that loose of a definition. Even if movies like The Worst Person in the World (2022) are good at portraying mental isolation/loneliness through lack of meaningful or satisfactory connections... it isn't really direct-lonliness. I'm talking ""scrolling through ig, no friends, no partner"" type beat. Lmao I promise this isn't a cry for help, just building an arsenal for a rainy day when I gotta raw-dog some emotions out lol.Here are some examples that I love. You'll find that modern mumblecore tends to be my jam:- Shithouse (2020)- Eighth Grade (2018)- Spinster (2019)- Almost Famous (2000)- Inside (2021)- Columbus (2017)

What do folks familiar with this director recommend as the next one (s) to watch?Also, any recommendation for other directors or films?

I liked the fact they were sat there playing some old, image-based escape game. I don't want an escape movie, I want something letting off computer-based nostalgia like Deadware did for me.

So a ""bottle"" episode of a show is one where the characters are in a static environment and mostly just talk to each other.  My favorite movies are The Royal Tenenbaums and Murder on the Orient Express (1974).  These movies where a bunch of personalities are stuck in a house or a train or whatnot and have to hash it out.Suggestions?  Of course I've seen Darjeeling Limited which is right up my alley.  Anyone have any suggestions for movies that involve a handful of colorful characters and a cozy environment?edit:  Thank you to all replies for the recommendations!  I appreciate it.  You guys have seen a lot of movies!edit: Anyone remember the trailer for Big Girls Don't Cry from the old TMNT VHS video?  I never saw the film but that atmosphere of a disparate family coming together is what I'm here for!

I do have Amazon Prime and would love a good suggestion on psychological thrillers and horrors that are either movies or series with a good story and twist.

Fantastic Hong Kong action films from the 80âs that I feel deserve far more attention! Directed by John Woo before Hollywood and Hard Boiled &amp; The Killer, also heavy inspirations for Quentin Tarantino..and starring Chow Yun Fat in his breakout role. His characters in these movies would honestly give John Wick or Rambo a run for their money, also the ending of A Better Tomorrow 2 has one of the greatest shootouts you will ever see onscreen, and have your eyes glued to the screen. The cast, the music, everything about these movies is just truly impeccable.

I would love to find movies where the characters are as grotesque, overacting as they are in ""Night of the Hunter.""  All the characters in this film, except the children and their father, seem comic to me, although I don't know if that was the author's intention, because the grandmother at the end, being a positive character, reminds me more of a comic and a bit frightening character.  I saw a similar thing in the movie ""Rabid Grannies"" , the family and servants are similarly grotesque characters, although in this case it is clearly done ironically.  I look for similar vibes, whether it's a '50s film or a more modern one, exploitation cinema or not. Older films would be more interesting, I don't know much about them. I've seen elements of this sort of thing in some exploitation films (Russ Meyer and Herschel Gordon Lewis come to mind), and it's always enjoyable, but I saw such actors and acting in the purest form in ""Night of the Hunter.""

Conversations with Other Women (2005) is a romantic drama movie with Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter in the lead. The movie is presented split screen the whole way through. While watching it you have two different perspectives, and it's a really interesting approach to the presentation and viewing experience. I won't delve into the details on how cleverly this technique is used, but it's pretty neat in my opinion. The tagline of the movie itself makes a nod this: ""There are two sides to every love story"".The main problem with this movie is that the Blu-ray release is ruined by the fact that they decided to only show one side (same with the streaming releases)! That release only shows 3 split screen scenes, but the entire point of the movie is that it was presented the whole way through in that way.If you decide to watch this movie out of curiosity, make sure to watch the DVD release! I think that the Spanish Blu-ray is also the correct split-screen version (for some reason), but I've also read that it's upscaled and not true HD.

By that I mean not movies that brings nostalgia to the viewer, but movies that are about nostalgia and their themes deals with nostalgia.The only one example that I can think of at the moment was American Reunion (2012), where basically whole plot in the inside was about some characters being stuck in the past and unwilling to move on and accept the present as what it is, looking back to those better (teen) years and trying to relive it again.Can anybody relate to that or even relate to the American Reunion movie and if yes, do you, by any chance know any other movies like that?Regarding the timeframe, the ideal outcome would be early 2000s, but we are not yet in that nostalgia filmmaking cycle (we are in the 80s, barely in the 90s now), so I could do with 90s, too :DThank you very much in advance for any response

I saw this film for the first time in February of this year and itâs never left my mind since. For those who donât know, itâs a Japanese anime film about a kid who bullies a girl who happens to be deaf and years later he comes to regret his choices and tries to be a better person and make things up to up.This might sound ridiculous but I think this is a movie everyone needs to see although it is pretty tough to watch at times. I feel like if you have depression or have been bullied or anything the characters go through could really work for a lot of people. On top of that, the film also has a great score, impressive animation and memorable characters. Just a fantastic film and one that I would recommend to anyone.

The best description I've come up with is that it's the perfect catalyst for a real-life Ludovico Technique. Its a Lynchian/Cronenbergian ball of surrealism and body horror that is honestly impressive given that this film was made over 18 months and self-produced by the writer, director, editor Shinya Tsukamoto. There are few films that turn out as good as Tetsuo where the visionary is so self-involved in the stages of production,  but somehow Shinya Tsukamoto managed to come out the other end with a masterpiece. In my opinion this deserves a spot in the Parthenon of cyberpunk classics like Terminator, Blade Runner, and Tron. Tetsuo's score (composed by industrialist musician Chu Ishikawa) is equally head-splitting and insane, and is in it of itself worth its own listening session for metal enthusiasts. For anyone that has come out unscathed from seeing Tetsuo, what are your thoughts on it?

This was such a fun little movie. A cafe owner finds out that he can see precisely two minutes into the future due to a literal time delay on his CCTV setup between his bedroom and the cafe he owns downstairs. Shenanigans ensue. A beautifully simple concept, executed superbly.At only 68 minutes long, it gets in, does the job, and gets out again at a great pace and doesn't overstay its welcome.The ""sensible"" time travel approach of something like Primer, melded with the ""one-take"" stylings of Birdman, but performed more like theatre than film, with an incredibly effervescent cast who all just exude enthusiasm.

What I mean is I donât want the main focus on of the story to be the fact that the characters are LGBTQ+ (so like coming out stories or identity struggle etc.). It can be a romance movie or any other genre really (except horror). The important thing being that the characters are interesting, three-dimensional characters first and not only focusing on their sexuality/gender identity. A recent example I can think of is the series Sandman on Netflix. Thank you in advance for any suggestions!

First of all, when i say arthouse i mean movies that you could easily imagine them being exhibited at the Cannes Film Festival (even if they weren't). These films are usually more intimate or more deep than the usual movies.However, i think that some times those movies are very plotless and not super entertaining.

I think most of these premiered at Cannes, but, as i said, it doesn't necessarily need to have been shown there.

I am in a mood tonight and it's my turn to pick the movie for me and my husband. I want something that is full of (good) sex, intimacy, teasing, and will generally turn all who are watching it on. Open to all genders, roughness, and languages. Prefer to avoid non-consensual or exploitative scenes. Preferably not something subpar like ""50 shades of grey"" and movies like that.

I would bet there is a good number of you out there who have seen Snatch. Youâve seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. BUT, you havenât seen Sexy Beast. Of course Sexy Beast is a different director, different cast, and different pacing, but it is still a British roughian heist movieâone that is a bit less focused on the heist and more focused on the predicament of an old pro being forced out of retirement by a stunningly brutal Ben Kingsley. Itâs funny, itâs different, and it belongs right up there with the other two Richie classics. If you havenât seen it, watch it now!

I always knew I liked horror, but until yesterday I had never figured what exactly I was looking for in a horror movie. Until i found my new all time favorite movie, martyrs. Every single scene in martyrs is pretty much dedicated to one of two things. Itâs either making us deeply care for the main characters, julie, anna, and the &gt;! basement girl!&lt;Or it is making those characters i care deeply about suffer unimaginable levels of pain. It may sound weird but i think thatâs always what Iâve always loved about horror, connecting with characters on a  deep personal level before they suffer immensely.It needs to be fully about the characters and the deep, struggles the go to. I want to weep and feel awful for them the same way i wept and felt awful for julie and anna

I usually stay away from the Horror genre but this one seemed a bit different, and I am glad I gave it a chance.  Its probably better to go into it somewhat blind. It has to be one of the best films of the year in its genre. It doesnt use gore or jump scares, but it had me feeling anxious from the start. I really loved the directors other film ""Thelma"" (7/10 IMDB), and this one was just as good if not better.  IMDB rates this one as 7/10. Rotten Tomatoes has it as 97% (tomatometer) and 70% (audience). I rented it on Amazon Prime.Edit: Eskil Vogt wrote both The Innocents and Thelma, however he didnt direct Thelma, but he did direct The Innocents.

After reminiscing movies I liked, it occured to me, that I love movies (or shows) like that.Can also be over the top (like Midsommar for example) or a humorous perspective on the culture (like in Bend It Like Beckham to a degree). Or an absurd one (like Greener Grass, I guess, but I haven't seen it yet).If the movie is historical, then I'd like to have the writers of the script or novel, it's based on, witness these times for accuracy.While I would prefer it, if the people working on the movie were part of that culture, it's not a must. It can also be an outsider looking in. The cultural aspect doesn't have to be the main focus of the movie and can just exist in the background or create the atmosphere.Some movies, I liked in that category:  Whale Rider (2001)  Rabbit Proof Fence (2002)  Mustang (2015)  Jungle Child (2011)  Wolf Totem (2015)  Anatevka (1971)Any culture (subcultures are also fine), any country, any language, any genre (though I don't really like romance, action or gory horror with jumpscares).I have a lot of movies already on my to-watch-list, but I'm sure there will be lots of movies recommended, that I've never heard about.

Extracted Movie Titles:","iâm having some friends over this year for some sort of halloween/horror movie marathon. almost like a watch party with a bunch of movies. i havenât seen a ton of horror movies but from the ones i have seen i really love. i just want to watch some of the best horror movies, preferably classics, but if theyâre newer but still have that old horror movie vibe, iâm down! 

just for reference i love anything with non-supernatural elements, more like crimes than vampires and ghosts but iâm always open to new stuff!

What movies would you recommend for someone getting into Film Noir / Neo Noir? So far I've seen The Maltese Falcon and Blade Runner (including the 2049 sequel), although that's more Cyberpunk, but they are closely connected genres.(I'm not sure if Pulp Fiction counts as a Noir, but I've seen that one, maybe Neo Noir? I don't know. I was tempted to add some Akira Kurosawa movies to the list, but I'm not sure if those count either.)I'm thinking of watching Chinatown. As well as the movie Se7en. The latter might count, but I'm just guessing based on what I'm googling.What else would you recommend?

I've been trying to Google this trope, but I guess it's too specific, so I came up with nothing.I'm trying to find thriller/police procedurals/detectives, where protagonists are:- cops/detectives- work on a case together- have opposite/conflicting personalities and approach to investigation- one is efficient, aloof, ""by the book"" type, the other is ""bad cop"" type, one or both have troubled past/substance abuse issues/dark secrets etc.- go from disliking each other to being friends/lovers (or at least, not hating each other's guts anymore)Perfect examples (not in the book format, but still): Beyond evil, Detroit: become human, Disco Elysium. I want more of that hahahI would appreciate any suggestions that have even remotely similar themes/dynamics. Thank you in advance!

My family loves to spend our time together by watching movies and it's kinda awkward everytime there's nudity or sex scenes on screen that we often have to skipped it. Usually when I'm choosing what movie to watch I'll just randomly pick high rated movie on IMDB that rated pg-13 but even then there's a chance of some nudity and sex references. So I think it'll be better if I ask for recommendations here.Some movies we have watched and enjoy are 12 angry men (my favorite), Forrest Gump (so good that we don't even skip the scenes with nudity), Inception, Alita Battle Angel, Planet of the Apes trilogy, Jurassic Park, MCU movies until endgame, the greatest showman, the sixth sense, the martian, miracle in cell no 7, the Truman show, Train to Busan, Edge of Tomorrow, Ayla the daughter of war, and Harry Potter.Some preferencesNo animation, no slow paced movies (my mother tend to sleep if it's too slow), no romance movies, no horror or thriller movies with lots of jumpscare and gore. It doesn't have to be pg-13 as long as it have low to none nudity and sex references.Edit: to clear some confusion, I think I have to explain some things. First, there's no kids in my family. The youngest of my family is at least young adult, the reason I ask for little to no nudity and sex scene is not because we can't it's just awkward. Second, we are asian who live and raised in our homeland. So our perception of sex might be different to westerners and I'm the only one who watch western movies and series quite regularly so the culture shock might be too much for the rest of my family for example there's this one time when my family watch CODA on apple tv and in mid film my mother ask ""why this one character so obsessed to sex? Why there's so much unnecessary sex scenes and references? Isn't it supposed to be a family movie?"" and she is not upset, she is just genuinely confused. This point should also explain my bad English. Last, the preferences are just preferences. Movie you recommend don't need to fit all the preferences but will be better if it does. That's why I still mention Train to Busan even if the preferences say no horror/thriller with jumpscare and gore.Anyway, thank you for all the recommendations. I really appreciate it.

I know this is really specific, and there may not be many things that fit. I've been looking for movies like this for ages and recently saw Last Night in Soho, which fits perfectly and made me wonder if there are more movies out there that I just haven't found.I'm looking for pretty much anything other than traditional time travel stories: someone having dreams or visions of a person in the past, people in different time periods living parallel lives, etc. It's okay if it's a one sided connection, and the people don't need to have contact with each other. My only specification is that it's not a romantic connection. It's all right if romance is a main part of the plot, just not between these characters.I'm interested in this theme and care more about that than movie quality, so it's okay if it's not the best movie ever. Any genre and movies from any time period (even really old ones) are fine, and series are okay too.Thank you!

I love horror literature but have avoided horror movies because I don't really like jumpscares or incredibly graphic torture scenes/gore. However, I saw NOPE in theaters and was OBSESSED. I wanted to watch it again as soon as the movie was over and I still can't stop thinking about it.Looking for atmospheric horror that is similar! Fine with some gore but I like spooky/creepy stuff better, also horror that makes you think or has some strong thematic elements. I really liked Get Out, The VVitch, Parasite, Alien/Aliens, and The First Purge. Also good with campy horror like Jennifer's Body and Freaky. I'd love to know about movies that might have influenced NOPE as well. Any suggestions are seriously appreciated!

I remember when BHD came out in 2001 - I was blown away by how thrilling the battle scenes were. Ridley Scott did such a good job of staging the firefight realistically but at the same time, keeping you involved in the story and the plight of the different soldiers as their situation goes from bad to worse. I watch this movie at least once a year. It's one of the most re-watchable movies ever. I would love to find another movie that scratches the same itch.

I am not a religous person in any way but I remember watching ""The Prince of Egypt"" long ago and being awestruck not by just the visuals, but how it told the story of Moses and I'm wondering if there is a film similar to that but related to Islam such as the story of Muhammad.It doesn't have to be animated, but I'm looking for an epic, awestruck movie based on a Quaranic story, one that will make you appreciate the people who worked on the movie.

The gift (2015) is definitely one of my favorite movies ever. I love the creepy, stalker vibe that was given the whole time. Some of my other favorite movies are the witch, hereditary, midsommar, and prisoners.

Iâve been looking really hard for a movie similar to The Gift for a while. Any suggestions?

So I am 18 and have had a really shit few years. Without going into too much detail Iâve kind of been bullied all my life but especially in high school, can only remember having close friends back at primary (elementary) school. Parents also fought a lot during those high school years, I was at a private school with rich kids and was from a ghetto poor area so hid it and was found out and bullied. Also got anorexia and nearly died a couple years ago during exam stress. Thankfully all of that is over, I am at college which is different to high school in the UK (12th grade) but still have no friends because of coronavirus and still having a messed up mind from everything that happened before. I feel like (especially from watching movies as a film enthusiast) I have missed out on the teenage experience and have never been to a party, had a girlfriend/boyfriend, or even just chilled with some mates since I was about 12 years old. My parents sometimes say âyou havenât lived yet, you have a lot to look forward to, university is an amazing experience and youâll find your peopleâ. Iâm gonna leave making friends until university because itâs final exam season and I want a fresh start and finally have the confidence to talk and be social unlike high school, but because iâm a bit depressed and feel like Iâm doing nothing at the moment and wasting my âbest years of my lifeâ, are there any good movies that can hype me up, lift my mood and get me enthusiastic about what life may bring in the near future. Maybe teach me some life lessons, just make me happy, motivate meâ¦. Just anything that may help my situation.For comparison here are some movies Iâve watched and loved, some just because they are so captivating they immersed me in the world, others because they made me excited for the future and what is to come in life, or ones that were just hilarious and made me laugh - little miss sunshine, booksmart, Superbad, Juno, requiem for a dream (because it made me realise how good I have it), 28 days later (canât be depressed when its a zombie apocalypse and survival is all that counts), the holiday, the terminal, the way way back, spirited away, hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, kids (wasnât just me who had it bad as a kid), uncut gems (makes you feel alive, that tension), mowgli, life of pi, Harry Potter, moonlight, the Florida project, tangerine.Some great series I like are breaking bad, Jane the Virgin, Rick and Morty, the good place, Benidorm, shameless, orange is the new black, the walking dead.

There's something about crime/thriller movies from about late 80's to early 00's kinda timeframe that I just love, that bleed over 90's decade timeframe.  Maybe even up to 08 :)Always watched these sorts of movies with my mum when I was a kid. Lately I have felt them relaxing me before bed for some weird reason. Probably a mix of nostalgia with that dark muddled colour grading and film type they all seem to share...I have seen so many it's hard to list but have at it, I am always good for rewatching if it's been a while.Starting my list of recently watched or over-watched:- Se7en- Misery- Cape Fear- Along Came A Spider / Kiss the Girls &lt; I wish there was more like this! This is what I want!- Zodiac- Primal Fear- The Silence of the Lambs or anything Hannibal- The Game- The Bone Collector- No Tarentino &lt; I'm after basic bitch crime thriller- American History X- L.A. Confidential- Nothing Gangster from the gang side of things - God Father, Good Fellas, Casino etc etc seen em, love em, but not what I'm after- The Sixth Sense - good but doesn't fit - Heat(1995)- Fight Club - good but doesn't fit - In the line of fire(1993)- The Firm- The Devil's Advocate- The Fugitive No supernatural, horror,  scifi, or something you would class as action movie more than thriller. Spy movies ok if they are slow burn (no bourne, reacher, mission impossible mission)

This movie was negatively rated by a lot of people and for the life of me I canât figure it out. Itâs a sweet, endearing comedy with an indie feel, but the comedic writing and style of Paul Feig films. It stars Melissa McCarthy (who co-wrote the movie with husband and director, Ben Falcone), Susan Sarandon, Toni Collette, Dan Aykroyd, Kathy Bates, and Sandra Oh. Itâs really sweet and legitimately funny. The plot is essentially a woman who needs a change in life going on a road trip with her grandmother.

This is a murder mystery similar to Knives Out but kinda like The Grant Budapest Hotel. The 1950s London setting is really great and the movie itself has comedic elements. It's based on Agatha Christie stories. It's great and I never heard about it, didn't see the trailer, didn't see a single advertisement for it. I definitely recommend if you want a lighthearted, easy watch in a cool setting and with a great cast.

""I decided to watch it, and had a great time. If I'd had to rank it I'd give it an 8/10. It had great visuals and cinematography, it had interesting concepts, and above all, it was HUMAN. You can look at this movie as Sci-fi, Horror, Mystery, and it stands alone great as every one of those, which is what's great about this film, but to me, it's most relevant category to me would be DRAMA, just because it's about these humans and their connections and their importance. And it's about hope. Watch it.

I am very much impressed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and his way of making movies, especially Amelie. Every part of the movie touched me. I watched Delicatessen of his but was not impressed much. Are there any other movies of his or any other directors that are very much alike to Amelie?

Hi itâs been a long time since I watched some good 90s movies and lately I realised that Iâve been missing it after watching Chungking Express. The environnement around it made me wanna watch more movies of the same genre and time. I do have Fallen Angels on my watch list at the moment but Iâd also like to have more recommendations if you do have some. My favourite type of movies generally is crime but Iâm open to pretty much anything (except horror and types like these where I generally find the whole story pretty absent or just boring) Some of my favourites areThe Usual Suspects, Scarface, Carlitos way, Reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, fear and loathing in Las Vegas, four rooms, Fargo and just recently Chungking expressI just havenât watched many movies from the 90s that were something else than crime types so Iâd like to watch other things tooThanks!

I donât like when they start after the disaster and people just talk about what happened but you donât see the characters go though it.

The main movie that fits this for me is the Handmaiden by Park Chan-Wook.  It was so easy to watch that it seemed like a really pleasant dream I created in my own mind.  It was simultaneously enthralling, in stressful, realistic, and sexy.  Iâve never seen a film combine realism, thriller elements, well-done sex scenes, comedy of errors,  and a formalist slow film all at the same time.  Itâs like watching an erotic thriller superimposed with a Kubrick film AND a Shakespeare comedy.   Anything that just dreams, floats and flies? Even my other favorite films like parasite, Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather, the shining, donât float in the same way to the same degree!

Everything about this film is just absolute perfection. It manages to subtly capture the depressing reality that is life for a large majority of people, but without being totally morbid and obvious. It is the subtle-ness that hits harder, because its so close to home. American Beauty is somewhat comedic and light-hearted despite being so incredibly heavy at the same time. The amount of comedy is just right. And to top it off, the musical score is just perfection - particularly the main theme - I often listen to it on repeat.People of Reddit: please provide me with suggestions similar to what I have described above!

 I'm looking for horror movies set around Christmas. Anything that mixes the bright, cheerful aesthetics of the holiday with blood and terror. Could have monsters, madness, delinquents, or just a regular family turning on itself. In the Netflix anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots one episode depicts Santa as a grotesque monster, so something like that would be great.

While watching some classic 80's/90's fare recently, it occurred to me there are a lot of family films that are primarily a lot of fun. But that also, for some reason, have a subplot that involves heavy crime. I'm thinking of films like:*Three Men and a Baby -* There's a whole drug smuggling aspect to the movie?! What?!*Vice Versa -* Should be a father-son body swap, but they added in some ruthless art smugglers as well?!I know there are more examples like these, and I'm fascinated by the idea that it was so prevalent in this era. Hit me with your memories of big crime as the B-story in fun family films. Looking forward to your suggestions!

I'm looking for gay characters who are contemplating life. Love can be in it but it shouldn't be the main topic. Moonlight was a ok, but a movie with more monologue (and dialog) would be perfect.

Movies with very introspective or cerebral protagonists/characters? For example, I'm Thinking of Ending Things, Adaptation (anything by Charlie Kaufman, so maybe excluding his), Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Into the Wild. I know this example isn't from movies, but also Angela Chase in the 90s TV show My So Called Life was introspective.

Even ones that include Aliens or creatures tied to ancient relics that when touched or taken, it releases something.I also enjoy some detective shows but they tend to be monotonous and can get boring quickly since they tend to be closer to crime shows.

I am looking for some deep psychological movies involving some sort of a relief/resolution to a cognitive dissonance (can be resolution to trauma, identity crisis, etc.) and a conflicting (seemingly correct, beautiful, yet morally wrong, involving direct/indirect harm, losing sanity in the process) catharsis of mind of some sort (like the endings of Joker, Midsommar, etc.), something most can relate to (in particular, I prefer realistic over sci-fi or fantasy).If anyone has any recommendations, please comment.

I tend to work late into the night as a web developer and would like a movie I can put on as background noise. I do a lot of compiling which takes anywhere from 30sec to 10min depending on what I'm working on so I'd like a scenario where I can check in every 10-15 minutes for 1-10minutes and still grasp it.  2001: A space odessy comes to mind only for the fact it is very slow and has a LOT of long VFX shots.   Basically any movie that might have long pauses or a bunch of unnecessary dialogue.

I'm passionate about film, but one of my least favorite genres is comedy- solely because I don't really find ANY of them funny. I think almost all of them are dumb/cheesy. The only comedies I've liked are Monty Python and Up in Smoke, but no others. I like extremely dry and deadpan humor (ive tried death of stalin too but it just didn't really make me laugh). Besides that, I like humor like CallMeCarson, Jawsh (its_jawsh) and Jschlatt on youtube. Not really sure how to describe that sense of humor without those examples, very ""meme-y"" humor I suppose, but even then there are different types of memes, humor wise. Can you guys help me find a comedy I might actually like?Edit: I know it's not necessarily a comedy but I love American Psycho too, if that helpsEdit 2: I like Mel Brooks and Gene WilderEdit 3: I also like tarantino films like pulp fiction and django

Written by Quentin Tarantino, starring Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson, this film seems to be a forgotten about gem. You can really feel most of the themes Tarantino would follow for the rest of his career embedded in this screenplay. Everyone on the cast (and what a cast) really gives it their all and brings the characters to life, the scenes are so well thought out and scripted they would all work as stand alone short flicks in their own right. There are little glimmers of the Kung Fu from Kill Bill, the history from Inglorious Basterds, the monologues from Pulp Fiction and the bloody violence of Grindhouse.

Hey guys, so I just listed some terms because I didnât know exactly what the genre or subgenre is called. But I watched âAngels and Demonsâ with Tom Hanks and absolutely loved it. It had pretty bad ratings but I didnât care. Then I saw itâs part of a series and watched âThe DaVinci Codeâ and loved it too. Iâll probably watch the 3rd âInfernoâ soon. But I realize that I love these movies that are like historical (although, even as a history buff, historical accuracy isnât important because this is purely for entertainment value), conspiracies, lost treasures, secret societies, archeological adventure, etc. Growing up I never watched the Indians Jones series, but i watched it with me GF and loved it too. And I also thought the new Tom Holland movie âUnchartedâ was fun. Also I enjoyed the older âThe Maltese Falconâ as well. Oh and I also loved the Nicholas Cage, âNational Treasureâ too. So any recommendations for movies such as these? I also have no problem watching foreign films as well, so feel free to recommend them too.

So I donât plan to be sloppy drunk but I may have a few tequila drinks and I want to watch a romance movie or a movie where romance is the subplot. The thing is I am kind of waiting for my ex girlfriend to decide she wants to be with me again, so I want a movie where it has a bittersweet ending. Not necessarily sad but something that shows romance doesnât always happen the way you want but itâs still worth exploring. The only other thing I ask is if itâs not too predictable. So a realistic romance movie that doesnât glorify a happy ending. Marriage Story and Eternal Sunshine are two that come to mind. I would a movie from like the last 20 years, and I donât mind subtitles as long as I understand the cultural undertones of the movie. Thank you so much movie lovers !(Preferably on HBOmax, Hulu or Netflix but am willing to rent on YouTube if you highly recommend it)

If you like satire, social mockery, sex, tropicalism, or shrimp coconut stew, this movie is for you.  Adapted from Jorge Amado's novel, Bruno Barreto's (director) film: Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands  released in the post Cinema-Novo Period, is constructed to engage with viewers in the mid-1970's in the midst of the sexual revolution, Second Wave Feminism, and the aftermath of counterculture dynamics. Main character, Dona Flor must decide âwhich is the more desirable mate: a drunken, skirt-chasing, abusive scalawag who can make your knees wobble with the slightest touch, or sober, oboe playing, respectful Mensch with all the sex appeal of a lobster bib?â (Janet Maslin, New York Times). Barreto creates a narrative in which Dona Flor must negotiate restraints imposed by bourgeois values, and her inner need for liberation. Get ready to indulge in carnival appetites and carnal desires..

I am requesting film suggestions that really inspired  you as a parent,  or the type of parent you would like to be in the future.  I'm  curious about stories and characters that you think demonstrate wisdom  in the delicate art of parenting.  They don't have to be ""perfect""  parents or anything, just portray something you found insightful, that conveyed an idea that you could see yourself at least trying to apply to your own parenting style.  And this could apply to mentor characters more broadly if they take on the role of a parent in some way.Before planning for a family, I didn't think very deeply about this as I watched movies, so I am kind of stuck on Mufasa from the Lion King as my cinematic model of a solid parent.  At least it's a good start.  I have also seen Captain Fantastic, and wow did that ever get me thinking about parenting styles!

Extracted Movie Titles:","I am requesting film suggestions that really inspired  you as a parent,  or the type of parent you would like to be in the future.  I'm  curious about stories and characters that you think demonstrate wisdom  in the delicate art of parenting.  They don't have to be ""perfect""  parents or anything, just portray something you found insightful, that conveyed an idea that you could see yourself at least trying to apply to your own parenting style.  And this could apply to mentor characters more broadly if they take on the role of a parent in some way.

Before planning for a family, I didn't think very deeply about this as I watched movies, so I am kind of stuck on Mufasa from the Lion King as my cinematic model of a solid parent.  At least it's a good start.  I have also seen Captain Fantastic, and wow did that ever get me thinking about parenting styles!","

Hey guys, I hope this question fits in this subreddit but I want to go to the cinema this weekend and I am not sure what to watch. I would love to watch Spider-Man but I havenât seen any other Spider-Man movies and not that many Marvel films in general. The same thing goes for Batman. I have never watched a movie from DC yet.

I am obsessed with the zerker Berserk I mean, anime. I NEED something similar, like the Witcher was good, and now I'm watching Mandy. Ideally just high quality non-boring films with common jerker energy if you catch my grift. Basically manly man adventures with little side characters and a main ultimate goal which he obtains over a long hard battle filled lifespan depressing ending or not. Just something that really gets you to be emotionally invested without being irrationally watching for just passing time, but because I want to learn a good background meaning or simply a pushing factor to do my best in life. Berserk made me realize our barbaric ancestors weren't messing around, they were traveling miles and hunting or fishing for survival. Defending their families and children. I enjoy the feeling these prehistoric tales make me feel the need to get up and workout or simply put my all into my life, ""for survival"" if you know what I mean by that.

Sunday is movie day at my house. Usually, we lazily scan through our streaming services until something compels us, but this can grow weary. Redundant. We have decided to up the ante. Starting next week, we will curate a double feature. The first choice will come from Ebertâs âGreat Moviesâ list. The second will be a movie that complements the first pick. This connection could be thematic. Or historical. Maybe the location is the same? One could be the antithesis of the other film. Or one is significant to the other somehow. Nearly any connection is valid as long as itâs logical. The goal is to watch good movies and have interesting discussions. They neednât be masterpieces, but they should be worth watching. I am going to avoid pairing up sequels or the same director/actor. Itâs always fun to watch two Cary Grant movies or Alien and Aliens, but these pairings feel a bit too obvious. While I could figure all this out on my own, Iâm curious about what connections others would make. So, I thought Iâd reach out to a movie-loving community, such as this one, to see what happens. First up is: **1: Casablanca. 1942. Michael Curtiz. USA.****âA cynical expatriate American cafe owner struggles to decide whether or not to help his former lover and her fugitive husband escape the Nazis in French Morocco.â  (From IMDb)**What movie would you pair with Casablanca to make the perfect double feature? And why? I have one in mind, but Iâm easily swayed.Edited for formatting.

What movie would you pair with Casablanca to make the perfect double feature? And why? I have one in mind, but Iâm easily swayed.

I donât think thereâs a lot of movies like that but anything with a to be continued storyline with prequels? Sounds quite rare but thereâs gotta be more movies that follow such a pattern.

Please can you suggest a good thriller for us to watch tonight? Something along the lines of Seven, Prisoners, Zodiac or a good spy/espionage film like Bridge of Spies. We also enjoy true stories like The Post, Argo or Spotlight. My parents really aren't into fantasy and sci fi (sadly) or superhero films and although they will watch the scandi thrillers, I don't think they're going to vibe anything with subtitles tonight (sadly). This is my first time posting here so I hope this request has followed the rules correctly. Thanks!

hi there, I just want to say first I'm looking mainly for films pre 2010 because of the vibe, colors, and tones they used before. So, I'm looking for movies where the protagonist(s) try to solve an enigma/mystery and they need to resort to other people, to go to other cities, and things like that.Some examples of movies that fit perfectly what I want are:* DaVinci Code* Angels and Demons* Ninth Gate* Secret WindowFor example, I could list ""Inferno"" too, since it's a direct sequel to Davinci and Angels but it lost its vintage tone due to having better quality.  I just want to disclaim that I'm not looking for Indiana Jones' movies.Thanks in advance to everyone

After watching *The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent* I had to watch **Paddington 2**, one of the best movies of all time. I mean sure there's like The Godfather, Schindler's List and all that but a close third is Paddington 2. The pacing in that movie is incredible. I had never seen anything Paddington before but all you need to know is Paddington is a bear who likes marmalade. Easily one of the greatest classics of our time.

Bonus if itâs in an period film, but not necessary.So it seems like a larger number of romance books/films/etc are geared to women, with women protagonists. The love story will play out with focus on both, obviously, but in these, the focus of the film starts with her, the male lead(s) is (are) introduced later on, and then their plot happens. Many modern films but also think Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice. We see both of them, but we actually go home with Lizzy Bennet and see her daily life, not Darcyâs, and get deeper into her mind overall.A second type is just equal focus on all characters, like an ensemble cast, with a little more focus on the two leads. Or ALL focus on the leads with almost none on other characters, if they even exist (The Before trilogy, or for one people thought less of but I still loved lol, I remember The Lake House w Keanu Reeves/Sandra Bullock had pretty much just two characters).The type Iâm looking for seems kind of rarer. Obviously there should always an equal focus during the love story, but seeing the mental buildup with a strong focus on his POV would be nice for a change.It also seems to be rare because Hollywood thinks that men only want to watch action, war, horror/gore, and sex-fueled emotionless type of stuff â macho power fantasy, a beautiful but temporary âarm candyâ woman on a mobsterâs arm kind of stuff. They target that market and ignore this one.I donât care about it being high-quality or a little cheesy. I would prefer serious to romantic comedy, but itâs not a big deal, Iâll take anything that fits this description tbh.

We recently watched Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and it was perfect. Good murder, good mystery, nothing too raw.It's a hard balance to find.

Extracted Movie Titles:","My partner doesn't like gore or anything too intense, scary, or violent. He's particularly sensitive to violence against women and children and portrayals of people in extreme distress. Especially featuring torture or gore.

Usually it's all good, but I'm in the mood to watch something seedy and crime-y, a la Basic Instinct, tonight. We recently watched Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and it was perfect. Good murder, good mystery, nothing too raw.

It's a hard balance to find. I've considered Raising Arizona, My Cousin Vinny, and Erin Brokovich, but I'm not sure how much cute quirk I'm in the mood for. Anyone have any ideas?","

Looking for movies where the detective doesn't have superpowers to recreate the whole crime based on a used tissue paper. Investigation should be realistic without it getting too boring.

I want to watch movies - preferably revenge plots, but not necessarily - where the main character fights and is extremely skilled/suave, so you get satisfaction from just watching.As I was watching I Saw the Devil, the guy getting revenge is satisfyingly good at fighting and dodging attacks, so he seemed 3 steps ahead of the opponent. I want a whole movie like that, where the main character (preferably not a villain, but can be an assassin or hitman) consistently hits the spot with how they fight and manage situations. Itâs just so satisfying to watch, and eliminates the anxiety of whether theyâll be hit any second. All recommendations welcome!

I just finished watching âAs good as it getsâ And I thought it showed a lot of interesting and insightful character development. Another thing I enjoy about the film is that it shines a lot of light on how mental illness can greatly affect interpersonal relationships, while also showing what healthy vs. non healthy relationships look like.So, with all that being said, does anyone have any suggestions for me?

 I recently watched The Celebration and loved it, and it was almost immediately followed by finishing season 1 of Succession. I also really loved Mad Men. Does anyone know any other movies that are in a similar vain to these? Just like, rich assholes, usually white, that do nothing but screw each other \[over\]. Comedies are fine but I would prefer dramas. I would love some recommendations! Thank you!

If you are looking for a film that isn't about sunshine and rainbows but actually addresses some real issues pertaining to one's mental wellbeing and how it affects your social life and how you are perceived. It shows how one can battle with demons but suffers in silence because someone else is hurting.

You will feel like watching it all over again just so you experience those feelings again.

Holy hell. I absolutely love horror movies and this is the best Iâve seen in years! Iâve seen it suggested on here but after reading the description on google I put it on a back burner. That was a huge mistake!! I was bored and thought âeh what the hell, might as well give it a shot. Worst comes to worst it sucks.â Itâs one of the few movies thatâs genuinely freaky- not because of jump scares or serial killers.. I donât feel like Iâm doing it justice but youâre seriously missing out if you donât see this movie.

Ok guys, have to stay at home for several times, bored, I need something to cheer me up. There are a lot of feel good movies, but I am more looking into nature, exploring new worlds, something for the own fantasy.

Some of my favorites are There Will Be Blood, Hell or High Water (and Iâm not into westerns, so that speaks volumes to how good I thought that movie was), No Country for Old Men, Goodfellas, The Godfather, Burning, Memories of Murder, Zodiac and many more. Mainly what Iâm looking for is something that doesnât require me to watch a YouTube video to explain to me what I just watched. While I enjoyed The Green Knight, I think the reason it soared was all the metaphors and mythology. The pacing is boring if youâre not dissecting the movie like an insect. I tried watched The Power of The Dog, but I was so bored that I turned it off before I could figure out what it was about. Moonlight is another one for me, good film I guess, but incredibly overrated. Maybe Iâm just dumb, but I want a great movie that feels great the first time I watch it, without having to watch a video to understand what the message was all about.

I'm writing a story about a person that is learning the weird rules and environment of a tribe and village that he has to pretend to be a part of. Specifically, the tension that if he's caught bad things could happen. &amp;#x200B;Can I get some recs for any good movies that could reflect a cult/village/tribe or secluded township of people that have crazy or weird ways they do things? Added bonus if there is a person who is trusted in that world. (some examples I kind of have in mind are Apocalypto, The Village, and even Ace Ventura Nature Calls.)

Like the title says, I'm looking for any great Sci-Fi films, which are relatively grounded/believable and have a fantastic score, like Hanz Zimmer's Interstellar score.I specifically love when the film really explores the vastness of space, and a deeper meaning or plot that really makes you think is a cherry on top.2001: A Space Odyssey and Interstellar are the best examples, but Ad Astra is another good one. Another one that I think somehow has the same ""feel"", although it's not a space movie, is Blade Runner 2049.Any recommendations?

I really liked the way the message of the movie was presented. You had to think. On the surface, Neiman overcame his obstacles and gave a brilliant performance. Heâs brimming with opportunity and now the world knows. However, the fact that the movie isnât actually about his musical ability is really cool to me. Itâs about obsession and an abusive relationship. Is that really a âhappily ever afterâ? Neiman and Fletcher both got what they wanted but at what cost?I also liked Ruby Sparks because it reinforced some of my beliefs on control and the appreciation that we donât get what we want.

Obvious classics would be stuff like Pineapple Express, Half Baked, Dude Whereâs My Car, Super Troopers, etc. Just looking for something either laidback, moody, visually stimulating, subtle or weird comedy, and/or interesting to the stoned mind. Doesnât need to check off all the boxes, just something similar. Some recent favorites have been Documentary Now episodes, The Beach Bum, Sorry to Bother You, or pretty much anything from A24 (The Lighthouse, Good Time, Uncut Gems, Mid90s, etc). Open to anything :)

Hello,The idea of communication and the technology involved in telecommunications too are both pretty interesting topics to me. Iâm also a fan of movies &amp; thrillers too so Iâm currently assembling a list of movies which are conceptually based around telephone based communication or have memorable set pieces based around similar styles of communication. Here are some I have so far:      â¢ Phone Booth.     â¢ Cellular.     â¢ Speed.    â¢ Scream.    â¢ When a Stranger Calls.        â¢ Compliance (2012).      â¢ Buried.      â¢ Taken.       â¢ Dirty Harry (the third act running between pay phones set piece).      â¢ the phone tapping in Goodfellas.     â¢ Dial M For Murder.     â¢ a lot of hostage/terrorist negotiation films (Inside Man, Captain Phillips, etc).       â¢ a lot of spy films (eg the phone call set piece in The Bourne Supremacy)Iâm trying to hopefully avoid the glut of uninspired bottom of the barrel horror/thriller movies that use the phone as a plot point in uninspired ways. Instead Iâm hoping to just hear movies that I mightâve overlooked but which are still cool/original/entertaining enough to maybe check out.Thanks!

Very feel good movies. Like movies where they pretend to be straight and just friends, and its basically a movie of miscommunications. Movies like Happiest Season and The Wedding Banquet. Something about these types of movies, of having the courage to come out is super wholesome. Though, not movies though where a character figures out their sexuality and then comes out, or about teens. Like adults in the real world, being openly queer, and trying to fit that into the perception their family has of them.  Thanks!

This remake of the classic horror film is set in San Francisco. Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) assumes that when a friend (Brooke Adams) complains of her husband's strange mood, it's a marital issue. However, he begins to worry as more people report similar observations. His concern is confirmed when writer Jack Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum) and his wife (Veronica Cartwright) discover a mutated corpse. Besieged by an invisible enemy, Bennell must work quickly before the city is consumed.

As the president of a trashy TV channel, Max Renn (James Woods) is desperate for new programming to attract viewers. When he happens upon ""Videodrome,"" a TV show dedicated to gratuitous torture and punishment, Max sees a potential hit and broadcasts the show on his channel. However, after his girlfriend (Deborah Harry) auditions for the show and never returns, Max investigates the truth behind Videodrome and discovers that the graphic violence may not be as fake as he thought."," Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, Trick r Treat, The Thing, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Videodrome"

So I've finally seen all David Lynch films that's he's written and directed. I've actually watched them one by one, very slowly so that I could study each film and read interpretations. Anyway, I'm on the side of the fence that David Lynch doesn't add weird things just for the sake of being weird. I love the weirdness and strange tones he creates but that they also have meanings behind them.So what are some other non David Lynch films that have  strong David Lynch vibes but aren't exactly David Lynch wannabes. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a film I'd gladly put right next to my Lynch collection. I appreciate all suggestions. Thanks.

Thank you in advance :)(For those interested: I grew up in the UK where they talk about racism as an American issue, my school taught us about MLK &amp; Rosa Parks, but I hadn't met a black person at that point. Once I got to the states I was in middle school, so it was hardly discussed since they usually cover it in elementary school. I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't know who Emmett  Till was until I was in college. As a result I have been educating myself to the best of my ability, I listen to POC creators on social media, I have listened to music by lesser recognized artists, and now I am expanding into film. I have seen a few films by Spike Lee and Jordan Peele, but I'd like to know what films mean the most to real people, not those lists created by corporations.)

It hit me today that the reason I don't like horror movies is because they are never really about anything scary (and rely on cheap jump scares). I think there needs to be an adult scary movie about adult scary things-- suddenly your house is plunged into darkness because you haven't paid your electricity bill, the phone keeps calling from Sallie Mae, your child starts getting sick, you have to socialize with strangers at a party, your blind date goes horribly wrong and you start wondering if you're going to become a crazy cat lady... you know, ACTUALLY scary stuff.   I'm wondering if there's anything out there like this. A friend said they would most likely be in the tragedy section of the movies, but I don't know... what say you, oh movie watching gods of Reddit?

Favorite movies include : the notebook, eternal sunshine and a walk to remember In the mood to drink tequila slow and maybe tear up a bit to a romance movie. Not picky on movies I just would like a well made one. Iâm a film major and even drunk I tend to not be in a mood long if the cinematography is bad. I also am not in the mood to read subtitles but I understand Japanese and a lick of Spanish so those are fine if subbed. Movies Iâve seen whic are similar to what I want : titanic, blue valentine, and revolutionary road.

Made by the Talking Heads frontman, this under-the-radar quirky film was clearly ahead of it time in it's depiction of American Consumerism in that it was not appreciated when it came out. It's melancholic yet heartwarming parody of the idea of Small Town America especially the transition from the 1950's to the 1980's. Perhaps good for the younger generations to get a taste of what the advent of ""mall culture"" was like. The soundtrack is great and people have said that it has elements of David Lynch and Napoleon Dynamite, but I'd say it's one of a kind.

I'm looking for movies that are a bit non-Netflixy if you know what I mean. I feel it is too forced, in that every movie includes one gay person, one Asian person, one black person, an interracial couple, a non-binary person, a strong female, a weak white man, an Indian, an Arab, etcetera... I get the point but it goes from trying to portray modern day real-life to portraying some kind of liberal fantasy and it distracts from everything else that makes a movie a great film. Of course I realize it's unrealistic that every single character is a powerful Christian white male but it becomes the same thing, just in a different way, when it's overly pronounced. I assume any Netflix film is off the table but what about the rest of the industry. Does what I'm looking for exist? If so, I'd love to receive some recommendations.Thanks,Skinnybitch3030Edit: Also, I'm not a fan of old and ugly actors. Example: Everything everywhere at once.

Even though in the latter you don't really see the conflict, as in no large-scale combats but  when they finally get to the Capitol, you definitely see the result of it.

Queer romcoms that I've already seen that fit this vibe: 

* But I'm a Cheerleader
* Imagine Me and You
* Saving Face
* The Object of My Affection
* Kissing Jessica Stein
* D.E.B.S
* The Wedding Banquet
* And Then Came Lola
* Happiest Season (tho I hated this and it was made in 2020)","

I just watched Gatlopp: Hell of a Game, and it reminded of how much I loved Jumanji and Zathura and their magical board games. I watched Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, hoping to scratch that itch, but sadly, while it was a great movie, it had very little of that magic compared to the original.I'd love to discover some more titles with similar magic game mechanics. I'm not sure if I've seen one that's not a board game. I may have, and simply forgot. But yeah, let me know about any magical game titles out there, board game or not.Also, it doesn't necessarily need to be magical or supernatural.

I have a heavy tendency to like movies when the main character is sort of the âchosen oneâ or they have special abilities.

I really like the dark and subtle feeling it gave without seeming like it has been specially made to be looked like that and kind of just integrated/fused the feeling all over the movie and eventually the watcher. If I have to compare it with another one I'd have to say The Batman (2022). The feeling that it gives would be the same even if there weren't even any dialogue in the movie. Or totally the opposite (I may be wrong here) Just by the main character expressing their thoughts or showing their personality like American Psycho. The reason I gave American Psycho as an example was I didn't really get the same feeling just by watching and getting the feeling from the background but from the main character. I tried to find similar movies on search engines but it just wasn't showing the results I wanted. Thanks in advance for anyone who tried to help.

These past couple weeks I've watched La Haine, City of God, 12 Angry Men, Chungking Express, Fallen Angels, In the Mood for Love. Currently on the watchlist is Memories of Murder, Seven Samurai, and Dr. Strangelove but I anticipate I'll finish those by this weekend and am hoping to expand my horizons. I'd love your input into some more quality movies that I'm missing, thanks.

I quite enjoy those movies and shows where there's a bit of that ""alternative reality"" vibe to it. Some of the Twilight Zone from the early 2000s was also good in this regard, and Black Mirror to some degree as well though people tend to trend towards the same suggestions when you only mention those. Horror or supernatural elements are also ok, ""something weird is happening"" is kinda key though.

Hey there,I don't have much culture of Indian films (Bollywood / Telugu). I remember I was amazed at the action scenes in Singham. I liked the badass-ness of them, the unapologetic slomo but also the creativity and choreography. The first third was awesome. However, there was still loooots of cheesy bits, a pseudo comical ending that I found cringy, and way too much singing in between.   I was wondering if there were some Indian blockbusters that would focus only on these slomo choreography without all the bits that, as mentioned above, found quite boring.

Any suggestion for thriller movies you would say are the best in the genre and set an example of what a thriller should be?

3 suggestions would be superb but if only 1 movie comes to mind that would be great too.", Zodiac

Then when to go to bed as many suggested and i agreed, need to just on the white noise app and put the phone down.Original:I have trouble sleeping for 4 nights already (even with prescribed sleeping pill which I took every other night).Usually at night i watched some shows on netflix or playing boring board games against bots, and for years this help me to fall asleep with my white noise app in the background but not this last 4 nights. I ended up with 3 hours -ish sleeping time last night, which is getting harmful for me since my doctor already advise to have minimum 7 hours nightly.It would be a great help if you guys could suggest any movies which do not stimulate at all, which can help me to getting sleepy and hopefully fall asleep..Thank you in advance

Hello! I am looking for a historical movie that is historically accurate. The plot can be fiction but I want the setting, props, and dialogue to fit the era accurately. If it is nonfiction and based off a true event, I want the movie to be pretty close to actual events (at least on the key points of the event).Some examples for nonfiction: Bridge of Spies, Dunkirk, Valkyrie, Gettysburg, Black Hawk Down, Donnie Brasco, The Passion of Christ, Captain Phillips, Michael Collins, Revenant (ik there are some differences but those are easy to pick out for me since I know the real story very well), Lone Survivor, Zero Dark Thirty, Heartbreak Ridge etc.For fiction that is set in an era historically accurate: Platoon, Fury, Unforgiven (1992), 13 Assassins, Saving Private Ryan, Pride and Prejudice, The Patriot, 2 Fast 2 Furious (lol ik but I can believe something like that could happen), The Bourne Identity (kinda drifting away from what I'm looking for but it is okay), Lethal Weapon (sorta), Gladiator (ik that there is some eh stuff in it but overall it is decent enough historically imo). Thank you for your similar recommendations!

I saw âLet the Right One Inâ recently, and I thought it was amazing. I loved how the movie had an eerie feeling from start to finish. I love how there was just as much of a focus on the development of the unusual friendship as there was on the supernatural aspect of one of the characters and the loneliness felt by the other. I loved how the visuals, while simple and subdued, somehow dominated and never quite let you get comfortable. The whole thing felt like a work of art to me.I would love to know of any other movies that are as hauntingly beautiful. It doesnât have to be a horror movie, but I think the genre works really well for evoking this type of emotion.

Preferably a human drama, not anything overly joyful or comedic (Iâm not drawn to those films usually but might give them a go if itâs really good), and not horror either (but again, wonât knock it if itâs good).Usually the types of films I like are romanceless, and they tend to have male lead roles, which gets boring. I want to jazz things up, but realise I donât know any. Hit me with what youâve got!Edit: wow some great recommendations, thank you! Iâll be going through them one by one. To add as well, nothing that portrays women in an overly sexual way either. Promising Young Woman is an example of a fantastic movie that doesnât fit this current description of what Iâm looking for. Just a woman being a human in a movie would be awesome.Edit 2: so Iâm guessing I need to watch Prey lol.

You know how people say movies with ghosts don't scare them because they're not real? Well I'm the exact opposite. I don't feel the slightest fear when confronted with a gory slasher or movie where the killer isn't a supernatural entity. Of course I'd be scared if it happened in real life, but in a movie I just think that a lucky break can make it end, like fighting back, as soon as you find a weapon you can kill the killer and get out of that situation, or ask for help or even just closing yourself into a bunker.While a ghost or a curse like the one from the grudge? I don't know how people can not be scared from something like that, I mean, sure it's not real, but damn that thing can come at you from everywhere, in your home, and you won't even hear it coming. You can get into a bunker and it would follow you, even inside a mental asylum or a prison, you aren't safe even in the places where you feel so and they can make you hallucinate scary shit and are unkillable. I find that scary af. It scares me even if I don't truly believe in ghosts irl...Still I think of myself as open minded, I want to see if there's at least one movie with a serial killer and no supernatural element that can scare me, and here I am asking for suggestions. Maybe because the protagonists are for once empathetic or maybe because the killer is just plain scary, can you suggest me a movie that will change my mind? Because at the moment I can't even begin to understand how people can even find something like Halloween more scary than The Ring or The Grudge or Insidious. (And by this I don't mean any offence to halloween, it's an amazing movie and the closet scene even got to me).Anyway thanks for the help! Hope my opinion isn't too controversial because usually whenever I present it (specially here on reddit but also among my friends) I get talked down a lot. Hope you can respect how fear is subjective and maybe find some movie that can scare someone who scares a little bit differently.

I recently rewatched Killing them Softly and keep thinking how the characters keep getting betrayed by their collogues. It made it feel like anyone could be gone at any time. What other movies have this double-crossing vibe?  Dog Eat Dog would be anothing good example and a really underrated movie. Willam Defoe as a Meth head is gold.

Hello everyone, I was hoping if you could suggest me some good movies where you end up doing something that you shouldn't have done, whether unknowingly or knowingly. For example, I mean movies like The Hole, Spiderwick Chronicles. They don't have to be fantasy or anything, just interesting with few people trapped and facing the consequences of their actions.

I need recommendations for Spanish movies. Iâm a senior in high school and Iâm in AP Spanish this year, so I have summer hw. Part of my hw is to watch up to nine hours of Spanish shows or movies, and then write a review in Spanish. So Iâve been struggling to find school appropriate shows or movies. If you have any recommendations that would much appreciated. They can be shows or movies, I just need up to nine hours in total, and hopefully stuff thatâs easily accessible. I have Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and HBO Max, so if you have any suggestions for something on any of those, thatâd be great. I donât have any particular genres Iâm interested in, Iâll watch anything.Also, I realize that asking for shows goes against the rules of the subreddit, but I figured it couldnât hurt to ask. If my post gets taken down, so be it. If itâs really that big of a deal, just suggest movies.Edit: Iâd like to emphasize school appropriate. Try avoiding rated R movies pls. Even if Iâm old enough to watch them, I donât think my teacher would approve. Thanks.

Hello I'm looking for films that are like the ones mentioned in the title. Movies that has a killer in the friend group. I really love these types of movies where you try to guess who the killer is in the beginning only to find out you're wrong in the ending. Movies that if the characters don't find out who the killer is they get picked off one by one.  Yes I've seen The Thing(1982,2011) but I don't count it to be in this group of films since it's an alien that only has instinct and doesn't have any other interests like revenge, hate, etc. I've also seen the movies Death on the Nile (2022) and Murder on the Orient Express (2017) but I also exclude these movies since it's more of finding out who the killer is but the main character doesn't risk being killed.   Thank you very much.

There are so many movies out there I haven't seen or even heard of. I'm trying to get into watching movies but so many things I've seen made me feel like I was watching three TV episodes. I'm looking for something that takes some brain power, some active watching . I've enjoyed things like arrival and A Tale of Two Sisters and the first half of Insidious. It keeps me on my toes but it doesn't put it in my face, at least until it's over and I can't stop thinking about it because I'm so fascinated even the second time through. I  like when things are up to interpretation although the ambiguous ending of American Psycho book and movie make me a little bit mad. I love visual storytelling and when I can make my own profiles on the characters. I like some Snyder films for this reason. Train to Busan had multiple points of view but I experienced it on my own through camera work and only necessary dialogue and there was a lot of emotion that made it realistic. I am okay with movies that are shorter though I find that less than 2 hours is not enough to develop or progress a story. Here I don't really care about rating or reviews but I hope that there's a lot of discussion online because I really enjoyed movies that make me think and read. Someone recommended Snowpiercer since I enjoyed parasite

Okay, part of the scene is of course the noir aspect. Marlowe is gathering information and partaking in drinking some Aquavit together with the stoned and drunk writer Rodger Wade, on his Wade's turf. The location is at a private beach. There is something about the way this movie is shot, where the images have this lush soft feel to them, I think the word *pastels* was mentioned in the IMDB trivia section. There are a lot of plants and light inside this beachfront property which makes it extra beautiful and dreamy. Maybe this feeling is just unique to this piece by Robert Altman. I just recently started watching his films. I have only seen The Player, Short Cuts, and The Long Goodbye. I am watching Nashville now. I like the drinking aspect of the scene as well, there is a wildness to it.  So any private beach high-end property bohemian movies out there? Looking for masters of cinema.Edit: Marlowe and grammar

Title pretty much says it all but Iâll be more specific. So Iâm an elementary behavior teacher, recently weâve got a new student and Iâm having a really tough time connecting with him. He loves adventure, and frequently tells me heâs going on âa monkey vacationâ with his pirate friends. I knew he loves movies and so do I, and I immediately thought of Indiana Jones. To my surprise heâd seen it before and loved it, could tell me more about Indiana Jones than Iâve ever known, but told me he was sad he could only watch one. I asked his mom what he meant and here comes the problem: He could only watch Crystal Skull as it was the only one without Christian iconography at the center!! Additionally he canât watch Harry Potter, or anything with âwitchcraftâ.I donât have any problem with how she wants to parent her child at all, but I thought this sub might know some *very* clean or light adventure films that could help me connect with my new student. He loves nature, dinosaurs, jungles, etc. I would just love for him to have something new to connect with. Thanks!

SO I just finished watching Arrival (2016) for the first time, like blindly got into it. Didn't know what it was about, just know that Amy Adams was there and saw the poster.

So i would like to know if there are sci-fi movies with similar vibes? I dont particularly watch sci fi, but I enjoyed Interstellar and Inception as well, and Interstellar made me cry so I think I DO enjoy sci fi in a way, but not in the way normal sci-fi movies are supposed to make you feel. So if you have anything similar to Arrival and Interstellar please let me know.

For example, an oversized Michael Jackson bursts out of the cosmos with the sound of a Tie Fighter blaster accompanying his birth.   Tito Jackson hits a power chord on his guitar so powerful, it  creates a bubble Big Bang that shapes the Universe.Iâd love to get some suggestions of movies from this era that really had those over-the-top sound effects accompanying the film.  Iâve seen countless movies but Iâm always in the mood for a rewatch.  I donât need to watch 2001 though,  Iâve seen the Star child being born more than enough times.

And it isn't pretentious.I also felt that way about the new show severance.Which other examples you feel perfectly combine or balance different genres or different worlds (indie like and big scale)?Thanks ahead

I guess I'm looking to find if such a movie exists.  I was just watching ""Married . . . with Children"", my second favorite sitcom, and was wondering if any comedy film has been made in the modern era (say 1970 on) that has the same rapid fire delivery of jokes (and maybe a laugh track) - something where the actors play to the audience in a way similar to a sitcom.  However, I'm not looking for a film adaptation of a sitcom.

I feel like this film sort of flew under the radar upon release. Ducournaus debut Raw (2016) became an instant favourite of mine, from the visuals and colours, to the story and cinematography. So I anticipated Titane (2021) for several months prior to its release, a cronenberg-esque body horror wormhole, and damn, it was a magnificent emotional rollercoaster of beauty and destruction, and I loved the soundtrack to match. Agathe Rousselle was perfect for the role of Alexia, with no prior acting experience and limited script, she graced through her character with poise. I love the world Julia Ducournau has been creating with her films. Iâm excited for whatâs next to come from her. If you like French horror, David Cronenberg, surrealist realismâ¦ definitely check out this director if you havenât already!

Just got done watching the TV series Humans and I really enjoyed the subplot of the suburban family that has to adapt to being brought into this huge global conspiracy.  I also enjoy movies that are Sci-Fi fantasy but focus on more personable things, like how an Alien Invasion effects one person and their relationships/life instead of watching soldiers save the world or whatever.  I like it when there's hints to what's going on around the world to help with the world building, movies like The Vast of Night or 10 Cloverfield Lane for example.  Another example (although not sci fi or fantasy) would be the horror series ""The Purge"" I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie as it was primarily focused in one house, about one family, the follow ups opened up the world and got ""too big"" for my taste, I like smaller scale.

So, I was just asking over on r/booksuggestions for recommendations of books where there is a person (or maybe a small group of people) who is having to try and survive in harsh or extreme conditions, maybe with a hidden threat or danger that they're trying to escape from. I like the more believable, psychological ""what would I do?"" type thrillers, so preferably no zombies, vampires, aliens, monsters etc (although I don't mind ghosts/supernatural). Although I was asking for books, someone suggested The Martian, which I believe has been made into a film, and someone else suggested a film called Arctic, starring Mads Mikkelsen, both of which sound like the kind of thing I'm looking for, so I thought I'd ask here for movie recommendations on the same theme.I've read The Revenant, and then watched the film, and enjoyed both, so that kind of battling the elements, nature, themselves - that appeals. I've also seen The Thing (Kurt Russell) - I love the idea of being trapped in a remote location like that, but the ""thing"" spoiled it for me! Recently saw Underwater (Kristen Stewart) - again, enjoyed the remote location aspect, but not some of the other stuff. Those are just a couple of examples. Thank you if you've read this far!

I have heard that Everything Everywhere All At Once is an amazing movie but Iâm scared that the Sci-Fi parts of it will not entertain me, because usually they donât. On the other hand, I really enjoyed The Lighthouse, itâs a top 15 movie for me at the moment (havenât seen The Witch yet). Can I hear some pitches/opinions on both movies? My top 5 favorite movies are The Godfather Part 2, Schindlers List, 2001 A Space Odyssey, The Godfather and Raging Bull.

They're super picky with movies and tonight I want to give them a fun movie to watch! For reference, they really enjoyed Midnight in Paris, Love Actually, Knives Out, CODA, The French Dispatch, and Grand Budapest HotelMy mom loves rom-coms while my dad is more of an action type of guy. While my mom liked the first two more than my dad, they really both liked Grand Budapest.They're fine with a bit of nudity/sex and violence but nothing too vulgar. I don't want it to get awkward. Also something with a bit of a happier ending/mood.Thanks!Edit: Added more movies they enjoyed.

I am across the country from my my mother and she is going into surgery next week. I have some friends who are willing to watch a movie virtually with me during this time period as a distraction. The last movie we watched together was Wonder Woman II, and before that Artemis Fowl, so we've decided we should probably watch another awful movie to continue the pattern.We're looking for something easy to follow (so we can talk over it) that makes no sense or is just terrible for another reason, ideally in a funny way. We've seen the latest Star Wars and Suicide Squad, so those are no-gos, and we like generic action/superhero.

Hey! I'm not english native speaker, so I want to start with my understanding of what is ""eerie"".For me, it's the beggining of alien invasion movies. Those quiet moments. News in TV. Noone knows what's up.   It's the lecture scene in Arrival.   It's the storm in War of the Worlds, where Cruise notices that the storm blows in opposite way than it should.  It's Joaquin sitting in the closet with his tinfol hat in Signs (that one resonated with me even more so lately, when ""I was literally him"" while doomscrolling news and forums before and after Russian invasion). Signs is also propably the most eerie movie I watched in it's entire lenght, as a whole.     I mention in the title ""not scary"", because I'm not a big fan of horror movies.  Altough -  if it's labeled as one - Nope had great scary moments. The stable scene or chimp flashbacks - that stare right to the camera. I guess those are at the border of scary/eerie in my vocabulary.  There's some great eerie moments for me in some kajiu movies - thats why I actually liked 2014 Godzilla, for not showing too much. Also, that H.A.L.O Jump Scene with 2001SO music was what scratched my itch.  In that note - Cloverfield Monster is for me an underrated masterpiece, full of eeriness. Cloverfield Lane too - but here, ending is the opposite of what I want.  My mind went into sci-fi direction now and it's hard to come up with other examples, but I'm sure there are non-sci-fi movies that would be great fill for this post. Chernobyl TV series was pretty eerie for me. I just love those unknown, uncanny, unseen, ""silence before the storm"" moments. And I want more.

After watching Gunpowder Milkshake. Iâm convinced that it contained some of the absolute dumbest goons ever to be hired by a shadowy organization.  Iâm not talking Stormtrooper aim.  Iâm talking killing each other in all sorts of moronic ways,  bringing knives to gunfights, waiting for grenades to explode at their feet.  If there was ever a henchman that had been hired from Craigslist,  this movie contained them.So before I can render judgment, I need suggestions of other action movies featuring awful henchman.  Not just bad aim.  Actively terrible at their job and making the worst decisions.  The only other movie that comes to mind immediately is Punisher: War Zone and Shoot âEm Up but those movies I felt were doing it for comedic value.

Hello! I loved Stray Dogs, Utama, The novelists film,  and Memoria.  I love films that critics love and audiences hate.  I love slow paced films that make you study each long static shot.  Iâm open to really long films as long as maybe 5 or 7 hours but if itâs extremely formalist and static and never gets meditative maybe keep it under 3.  Natural beauty adds points, as does unusual locations, leftist politics, and mindbending situations.

Doesnât matter what period theyâre set in. Would prefer to avoid movies heavy in CCP propaganda. Can be Chinese, Hollywood, or whatever. The perspective can be either Chinese, or deal with foreignersâ adventures in China.

This is a very specific ask. My favorite movies to watch during a storm are spaghetti westerns, specifically ones that have comedic elements in them and that have Terrance Hill, Bud Spencer, and/or Henry Fonda in them. My all time favorite ones are; âThey call me Trinity (1970)âTrinity is Still my Name (1971)âMy Name is Nobody (1973)âThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966)Iâm not big on westerns that have a high production value, like John Wayne westerns that have intricate soundtracks and settings. The simpler, the better. Also please suggest ones that have English dubs or are in English haha.Iâm not opposed to modern ones if they fit the bill, but I generally like older western movies more than anything modern. The only exception to my ârulesâ that Iâve found is Shang Hai Noon (2000).

I had the television on while doing housework, and was watching [*Lara Croft: Tomb Raider*](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1995-lara-croft-tomb-raider) for the umpteenth time.  I don't know why it never registered to me before, but Jon Voight and Angelina Jolie, who play father and daughter in the film, are *really* father and daughter.  That got me interested in the dynamic of relatives acting against each other, and I am now curious what other films might be out there with relatives, particularly where they play their actual relationship onscreen.  There are obvious ones like films with twins (the Mowrys, the Olsens, etcetera), and I know of a few like [*The Krays*](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/21344-the-krays) where the Kemp brothers from Spandau Ballet play the titular gangsters.

Are there any good movies where we can hear the main characters thoughts? It could be any genre.Don't read this shit if you don't want to, but I have this idea for a comedy movie where we constantly hear the thoughts of a socially awkward man who overthinks everything. During sex he's like ""my back is itching, should I scratch it or will that turn her off? Whoa is she licking my nipple? Am I supposed to like this or is she doing this because she likes it? I wonder if mom licks dads nip... no no fuck why the fuck would I think that. Okay think of something sexy. Would it be disrespectful to her if I imagined Scarlett Johansson naked?"" And it goes like that for the entire movie. A movie like that would be hilarious so I hope it exists.

I've realized lately that I watch movies almost exclusively with murder/violence being a prominent theme. I'm getting sick of it. When I watched Man on Fire, I loved the first half. The relationship between Creasy and Pita was heartwarming, but didn't feel forced or cheesy in a ""disney"" kind of way. And it dealt with mature themes, like denzel considering suicide. But as soon as Pita was kidnapped, I didn't like it as much. It felt like it glorified violence too much, almost like a saw movie.Some movies that I've already seen but are what I'm looking for would be Secondhand Lions, Sing Street, and Intouchables.

     I find it hard to describe the feeling of what I'm looking for here. I'm not really looking for an actual noir, as I found out I like the aesthetic, but not the movies, as I think I'm looking for something with a little more sci fi. I'm looking for a cold, mysterious movies that has to do with backroads and something more than meets the eye. I really like the Blade Runner aesthetic, I liked the beginning of Dark City, but not the whole thing. Didn't really like Drive or The Maltese Falcon. I really liked Sunset Boulevard, and I feel like that got close. Mulholland Drive may come to mind, but that isn't exactly what I'm looking for. I'm more thinking along the lines of something that is a cross between Sunset Blvd, Goodfellas, Blade Runner, Citizen Kane, Long Days Journey Into Night(2018), and maybe like Akira and Space Odyssey as well.      I dont really know. I just have this idea of old style Hollywood noir that I can't express, and seems not to exist; it feels like a nostalgic memory.!Spoilers Spoilers for each movie/show I listCitizen Kane: Just the sheer scale and scope, but also the scene where the guy is interviewing the now old lady in the bar that is as past its prime as she is. I like the vibe of a long since run down society or place, later restated by Charles being alone in his big house and dying.Rick and Morty: Yes, I know. Weirdly enough though, a few scenes from the show fit this description. One where Rick and Morty are cops on a planet full of themselves and they are in some downbeat bar. And another, from the NGE parody episode, where they are driving down this alien highway with some floating rocks and stuff, it just really vibes.Sunset Blvd: The emptiness of the architecture, reminiscent of a Fellini film, or La'Venturra.Thank you for any and all responses!

Hi all, I wanted to find some movies to watch with my Dad, who has typical dad-taste in action movies (think Tom Cruise, Jack Ryan type-stuff), but also has really enjoyed historical fictions based in the 20th century (he's about 70), i.e. WW1/WW2/Cold War type stuff.For instance, I've watched Chernobyl (HBO), Schindler's List, Dunkirk, The Imitation Game, 1917 (Sam Mendes) with him and he's loved those. He's really liked Munich: The Edge of War and Argo as well (I guess war movies strike a chord, although he didn't really like Inglourious Basterds). He hasn't liked the sci-fi recommendations I've given him, like Interstellar.Are there any other movies or limited series that fit these lines? Preferably Hollywood/mainstream-ish, filmed within the last 20 years or so. Thanks in advance!

Preferably pre-bad thing. So not looking for movies that deal with... Say one partner cheated and are trying to build trust again. I'm looking more for forming trust before it got kindles/ignites/just after.I've got PTSD and the last two year have been a huge struggle trusting anyone, including close friends. With a lot of therapy I'm back to a fairly stable place. To the point I'm almost dating someone. But it's a casm between my trust levels before and after my traumatic event.Just wanna relate to the difficulty of trusting someone new you're pursuing. Don't have a movie example, but a show I've really been digging is You're The Worst, which features two anti-couple people who become a couple and their difficulties. Trust and support are huge topics in it.

Iâm generally searching for more dark/sinister themed thrillers and horror films because the darker they seem the scarier they tend to be imo, but iâve seen so many iâm not sure there are any good ones left.

Howl was everything I had hoped for in a creature feature film. I especially liked the atmosphere of the movie. The main characters were acceptable, but there is something I like about movies where people get stuck in a vehicle that is barely working and have to protect themselves from creatures and hopefully get the vehicle started so they can escape. I would love to see more films like this.Antlers is another cryptid movie I liked. It featured an actual creature and has decent characters with a decent story.

Hi! Iâve been having a debate with my girlfriend for the past week and I need some help settling it. We were talking about stupid and dumb running gags in movies and ended up talking about movies where people step in dog poop. She thinks more men step in dog poop in movies and I think more women do. We decided to settle it by putting together a list of as many movies as we could where people step in dog poop. If anyone has knows of any movies where women step in dog poop I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks![EDIT] Thanks you to everyone who has posted! Your help is greatly appreciated. However, I would like to just send out another general reminder that Iâm looking specifically for movies where WOMEN step in poop. I am again very greatly for any and all responses, but I would like to shift away from the male side and work exclusively on movies with women stepping in poop. Thanks!

We were talking about stupid and dumb running gags in movies and ended up talking about movies where people step in dog poop. She thinks more men step in dog poop in movies and I think more women do. We decided to settle it by putting together a list of as many movies as we could where people step in dog poop. If anyone has knows of any movies where women step in dog poop I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

[EDIT] Thanks you to everyone who has posted! Your help is greatly appreciated. However, I would like to just send out another general reminder that Iâm looking specifically for movies where WOMEN step in poop. I am again very greatly for any and all responses, but I would like to shift away from the male side and work exclusively on movies with women stepping in poop. Thanks!","

It would be great if you guys can suggest movies where maybe the protagonist has a health condition or some weird inexplicable issue that helps him/her triumph the conflict. Would be nice to see those ideas. Thanks in advance!

I really enjoy thrillers that take time to flesh out their setting, making it feel like a character in its own right. To give some examples, films like Knives Out, The Gift, The Invitation, The Shining, Coherence, Parasite, Ex Machina etc. Films that really familiarise you with an indoor space and focus predominantly on building tension through interpersonal conflict.

This is a very curious little movie with some flaws - the acting is borderline diabolical at times, for instance - but the general imagination behind the production makes it a really fascinating watch.A flailing artist builds a maze out of cardboard in his living room, the inside of which transcends the rules of space (it's bigger on the inside) and his friends have to go in to rescue him. It's like a PG-rated horror in places, but the design work and ideas are so great that it's well worth checking out.

 existence cant begin, non existence stays the same. then, existence has no beginning or end.the who created God is solved by the conclusion existence always is, uncreated, unconditioned.

Eternal return?from this I believe, or intuit, in a sense, that the Universe ""kills itself"" to close the loop. this isnt good or bad, it just happens. it thinks it ends the whole shebang only to begin anew with that motion, exploding once more into the Big Bang, the absolute point of separation of everything, right? think about it, given that substance is empty, no frontier between stuff, no stuff, oneness and no one, then the Big Bang as the beginning of linear experience of this circle is the point of absolute separation between anything that can possibly exist. from that point the energy once again moves toward itself, in a process of reverting into the ""initial"" points from which everything stems and where it all ends: formlesness, unity. all thes goes up comes back down.from that point ""forward"", from what we observe, energy starts clumping together in increasing complexity, forming quarks, subatomic particles, atoms... etc etc u get cosmic gases, stars etc and here u go a guy asking for a movie that talks or hints about or whatever about this process, this (seeming) truth, this paradox of beginning at the end. a closed loop. idk. i tried my best describing the feeling with words and concepts that allude to it, i trust and hope some vibe was transmitted and you have a movie in mind!possibly relevant: i watched Predestination and it was not bad. but the way it treis to convey this beginning&amp;end felt superficial to me, infantile. what im looking for is something more... serious? heavy? deeper realization? idk, i could say i want the feeling you get when watching a movie with some big conspiracy and the seriousness of the situation dawns on the characters and you watc, intrigued and amazed at how serious it all is and see how the whole atmosphere hints at it, almost warning you hey the truth is hard! but i also want the movie that exposes it all in an obvious way in your face... so if you still with me here just give me a movie you suspect i might like. thank you for your time btw &lt;3

Inspired by the question - which movie you could only watch once. But I wonder if you have a movie you keep coming back to watch, and what does trigger it for you, if you already know it all?

I recently watched âAloneâ and I was hooked from the start. They pulled off writing a  strong female lead who despite her physical and psychological weaknesses, she remained calm during stressful moments, made good decisions and used her environment to her advantage. I highly recommend the movie.

Hi! I was wondering if yall knew any movies about young people just being young people. It's kinda hard to explain, but the movie that I'm basing this post off of is called ""The Night is Short, Walk on Girl"". It's about this girl who goes drinking through the night, which seems to be neverending as she dances through life. Something that's not really a drama, but just a nice coming-of-age or a relaxing movie. Thanks!

City of God is one of my favourite movies of all times, it just feels so real. Everything about the film is amazingly well done, and I want to see something similar in theme to that. In particular films about crimes, gangs, violence , perfect acting, great characters, slums, all the themes and core ideas that the City of God had. The movies suggested do not have to abide by all those ideas but at least most of them. I have already watched all of Scorsese's catalogue and some other similar films from Tarantino. While I really, really like those films and would not mind seeing other things like those I am looking for something that feels as real as the City of God, a film where really no one wins, it shows the world in a non-biased, non-Hollywood esc way (not that I hate those types of movies, I just prefer it less) City of God  really feels like they just filmed their daily struggles first and a film second. Any language is fineï¼as long as it is easily accessible) , rating does not matter, anything goes really. I do not know if any other films can catch the lighting in a bottle feeling the City of God gave me but I might as well try and search for it. If someone else has created a similar post to mine I would also love to that.

Like, for example we'll take the old ""BFF has a secret, MC finds out by following BFF"" plotline. What I mean by 'oblivious to the plotline' is that MC doesn't follow the BFF, because why would they? That's just plain creepy! I want a movie that doesn't feel like a movie. The MC acts like an actual human being by thinking these kind of things. Any movies like this?

When does an upcoming movie get announced and how do I keep track? The last ones a dumb question but how exactly do yâall know if youâre looking forward to a certain movie if the trailer hasnât dropped yet? Do yâall just read up on itâs director and production company?

I loved There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, Apocalypse Now, and Falling Down. Clint Eastwood's acting in Gran Torino was OK, but the characters were kinda meh and so I am hesitant to watch Unforgiven despite the very high 8.2 imdb rating. There Will Be Blood was great because of the grittiness, discomfort, sociopathy, and brutal unfairness. No Country For Old Men was great because of the helplessness and downright out of the blue events. Apocalypse Now was good because of the madness and speculation. Falling Down is less special, but I found the main character to be quite relatable, especially the opening scene.All of these things are good and set each movie apart from each other, but what is more important is what is consistent across most/all of the movies (potentially ignoring Falling Down).I should also mention what I believe to be a similar movie that I didn't like that much for some reason: The Irishman. Maybe it's because I couldn't make much sense of it similar to how I couldn't make much sense of The Godfather and so I didn't like it that much.Edit: I should also mention that I found Joker 2019 was more mainstream but was pretty damn good.
